They have a great selection of movies && TV shows. They always have new releases so you should be able to find something you haven’t seen before because they do always add new movies && TV shows. They also have amazing customer service. Out of all the years I’ve had them I have only had to reach out twice. (Both my own fault not NetFlix’s. They helped me with the situation very fast && correctly! I’ve had other streaming services but, Netflix is by far my favorite. I think I’ve tried them all && I have only kept Netflix && Amazon Prime. I don’t really use Amazon for watching movies. I just use it for fast shipping && other prime benefits. I will continue to keep Netflix for sure! I love the selection they have && how easy it is to navigate on my smart TV && phone. Others places just really can’t compare. One thing I don’t like about Netflix is that they went up on their prices && before the price was great! Hopefully they don’t go up anymore because that’s the one thing that will cost them a wonderful customer.",5,Bestcompany,,TN

And still watch them today and still discovering new shows and movies that I wouldn't have been into wheil.i was a kid. And tbh I dont get why Netflix is getting all the hate it is. People need to realize Netflix is an icon and paved the way for many of our streaming sites we have today. If Netflix were to just up and stop its company just know that it would go out as a legend and never forgotten like its  predecessor blockbuster. I would really hate that tbh.

I don’t know when they reformatted  it or did the last update but they got too much crap on here now it doesn’t run right ! And when I say crap I don’t mean the shows I mean the stuff that’s running by itself! It’s kind of like apps running in the background of your computer. It’s got stuff running that shouldn’t be running. And I have to wait forever for something to download! I am not having problems with any of my other streaming apps!

My only problem with the increase amount that they are charging us they have dropped some of the older movies that we like to watch.

A few of the features I like are the ability to like or dislike a movie or show. This helps with the Netflix analytics to help pick other movies you may like and keeps those you wouldn't off your recommended list. Another bonus to the like or dislike feature is it allows you to quickly see if you have watched a movie before or not and is a feature some other major streaming services don't offer.

When I think of streaming I tend to think of live shows and thats the only negative to Netflix... nothing is live. However, they are constantly adding the latest seasons to the most popular shows and they also have a wide variety of things you can watch. They even produce their own exclusive shows (Netflix Originals) which have great production quality and are incredibly binge-worthy.

2022-02-05,Netflix has stood the test,"Netflix has stood the test of time by adding and growing streaming options. There are movies and TV shows new and old as well as Netflix originals that branch across the genres. I think of the streaming platforms, Netflix has the cleanest interface and most user-friendly format. Where Amazon Prime and Hulu Plus require a longer navigation to the search bar, Netflix search function is accessible from every row of shows/movies.

The only downside to Netflix is it seems to have faster turnover rates for content - meaning that some streaming options are not available for as long (I assume due to licensing limitations, etc.) as other platforms, but it varies. 

I'm heartbroken when a lot of the options are pulled, but ultimately, I think of all of the streaming platforms, Netflix is the one that definitely will not go anywhere.",5,Bestcompany,,HI

2021-02-05,Shame on you Netflix! How,"Shame on you Netflix!  How could you take advantage of faithful patrons who depend on your services to get through a pandemic. 

Really!  Netflix undoubtedly profited during from this pandemic and increased members.   Therefore,  Netflix mind as well take advantage of  the situation even more by increasing g rates?  

Have a heart and empathy towards your loyal patrons and new members.  Have Netflix forgotten that we are in the middle of a pandemic?  People are mostly unemployed, facing foreclosure, maintains home schooled children.  

“God” don’t like ugly! or greed! 

Most people resorted to becoming a Netflix member because it was meeting their financial budget.  Not to mention keeping their children occupied with movies without added expense.  . 

What a betrayal for those joining Netflix during a pandemic.  The public mind as well joined their local cable service or shopped online for DVD’s.

Unfortunately,  for Netflix your greed will cause more of your members to cancel.  As like me, I’m retired and on a fixed income.  Some are living without income.

Netflix, this is not the time to increase rates.  Netflix will benefit more remaining at the $12.99-$15.99 rate which most can afford.  At the end of the day, Word of Mouth Rules far better than unexpected rate increase.

Sometimes, America can be so greedy and consumed materialistically. However, most consumers seek a bargain within their budget.  This pandemic is, in my opinion, God’s way of saying “stop and observe your life” and it’s rewards.  However, ..... no one is listening.

Netflix, try putting the people first, for a change.  

Be safe!

From a concerned member!

2020-02-06,I have used Netflix for,"I have used Netflix for the past 9 months and have been very pleased with how it runs. Netflix has TONS of movies and TV shows to watch. I usually have no problem finding something to watch every time I watch Netflix. I like Netflix better than Amazon Prime because Amazon Prime has very few free choices for movies and/or TV shows. Most times I use Netflix rather than Prime because I don't want to pay to watch that particular show. I'd rather pay a monthly fee and not have to pay for extra things. Netflix charges $8.99/month and you don't have to make any extra payments which is really nice. The one thing that is frustrating is the fact that Netflix doesn't keep all of its shows on the service at the same time. They take shows off every once in a while, which can be rather annoying if you want to watch a show and only have a few weeks left to watch it before they take it off of Netflix. However, the Netflix originals are usually always available, and fun to watch, and even if a TV show or movie you like gets taken off for a little while, you can usually find something else you like to watch!",5,Bestcompany,,UT

It works! I have no qualms with Netflix. I decided to do away with cable it was getting way too expensive. 
Netflix does come free for T-Mobile customers however, just the personal plan. There are a growing number of “free apps” I could use however, what is keeping me here is the Korean Drama spread they produce. 
Netflix has grown quite a bit! Plans start as low as $7.99

The other great features of the service are the  ""play something"" feature, the personalized profiles, easy to navigate on the website and in the app, and the wide variety of languages content is in. The only feature I would consider a flaw is the way Netflix removes certain content to be able to add new content.",4,Bestcompany,,MO

The improvements have led to my family and I being able to stream shows and movies directly from our phones, tv and laptop. This has allowed for us to access this platform pretty much anywhere we go. I also like how you're now able to download movies and shows straight from the app before you go somewhere with little to no connection; this has helped make road trips less boring. 

I gave Netflix four stars however, due to the shows and movies list becoming a little dull. Netflix also removes shows and movies that are good too, such as That 70s Show, The Office, etc.",4,Bestcompany,,NJ

One negative is that sometimes before you have a chance to finish a movie with many series, it will disappear never to appear again. So its important to watch the series quickly in case they take it away. However, a positive is when you go away for vacation you could watch Netflix on tv where ever you are.

I will say this: they offer the minimum amount of entertainment to keep me paying what I am paying every month. When the streaming wars started, it was left in the air whether or not Netflix would be something I continue to pay for.

I don't even know why we bother having any hard copies of movies because they would rather watch the shows Netflix has.  They also much prefer using Netflix over Amazon, although Amazon and Netflix seem to flip-flop with who has certain shows, so we'll occasionally use Amazon more when the show they're into changes to them.  I wish that there was a way to get rid of certain shows that show up on the kids' profiles, as of now I just have to tell them which ones they can watch and which ones they can't (last I checked there wasn't a way to do this, maybe this has changed).

Although we did join a streaming plan later, we continued with the 2-DVDs-per-month plan and have rented nearly 1700 DVDs from NetFlix in addition to the streaming. The availability of DVDs is useful for seeing movies that are not readily/freely streamable or available to rent through an outlet such as Redbox. NetFlix streaming has introduced us to many good television series that we likely would not have known about otherwise. We've particularly enjoyed some of the BBC series. Unfortunately, NetFlix is losing some of the content it has licensed (including ""Midsomer Murders"" and more well-known series such as ""The Office"" and ""Friends), but there is still a lot of content available and NetFlix has released some entertaining content of their own as well.",5,Bestcompany,,CO

Netflix is available on TVs, computers, and mobile devices. Primarily, I'll stream movies and TV shows on my mobile device and I've never experienced any glitches with the app. In addition to having TV shows from other companies, Netflix produced their own films and shows. The only concern I have with Netflix originals is that they rarely get a second season, and when they do it takes over two years to be released.

I rate five stars simply because that’s the highest I could give it, but it’s more than just five stars, in fact it’s beyond measurement. It’s more spiritual than anything else.

Great variety of shows, including excellent original programming, fast streaming, no commercials, and easy access through a variety of platforms (we use Roku). You have to watch their ratings, because they are not the same as you will find on broadcast TV. TV-MA on broadcast tv doesn't contain anything that can't go over the airwaves, though the subject matter might be mature. On Netflix, TV-MA can mean anything from vulgar language to explicit violence and nudity. So viewer beware with original programming!

2020-02-06,Recently had an account stolen:,"Recently had an account stolen: someone logged in halfway around the world, changed email and password so I no longer had access. It was only an annoyance but I had to cancel the account, losing preferences and saved spots to make a new account. I was under the assumption I'd be able to partake of the 30-day trial. They said they could so on my device I had used Netflix before so I didn't qualify. That's fine, we'd probably use it anyway-- but wait, you can see devices to make sure people don't get free stuff but not to have accounts effectively stolen? I then asked if I could have the same billing date as I had been a customer for quite some time (years) and they said I would have to cancel at the end of the month they charged me on my new account (so I got charged twice for this month basically) go without for a few days and then restart the account. This is their brilliant way at handling customer service. I know this is all petty and people will likely scoff, but this seems a bit ridiculous to me. 

I do like the parental controls, as I have a 3 yo who regularly tries to watch what she shouldn't (she doesn't know of course), and they do have many shows I like. However, because of their late postings of new content I have purchased other services such as Starz and Showtime which is only a few dollars to Prime which I already pay for, along with having Hulu.

My only complaint is that much of what Netflix produces in shows and movies has a TV-MA rating.

The other problem is there are no on screen audience rating such that you spend more time looking for something decent to watch than it's worth. Lately they have been rating the top ten movies (supposedly) that are available on Netflix. Pretty limited selection within the rated feature movies. Prime makes the process much easier in that all movies and series are rated on screen and ratings are not limited to the Netflix audience only. We simply look for something that looks interesting and limit our choices to features rated 4 stars or better,  We  have basically given up on Netflix.  I called Netflix about this issue a few months ago and was told they are ""working on something"".  Would love to hear suggestions about which of the steaming services is the best in terms of their offering's and the quality of their features.

2022-02-05,HERE COMES THE BS AND,"HERE COMES THE BS AND CORPORATE GREED IN THE PANDEMIC. Here is my dead on honest review. You decide to stick with Netflix after this. I will back pedal a bit before I launch into this and tell you I have subscribed also to Prime and Disney+ without as much as a hiccup. So here it is: While ALSO having Prime, Disney+, and my cable bill skyrocketing in this pandemic, my husband missed some of the Netflix shows we used to watch PRIOR to the Disney+ launch. My kids only like Netflix for Sofia the First, currently not on Disney+. Fine. So what do I do? I get my husband a gift card for $25 as part of his Valentine's gift and we sign up for the BASIC PACKAGE ($8.95) on April 12. That should take us to July 12 give or take for $25, right? I go about my life and barely watch Netflix. I let husband and kids have it. Next thing you know I am charged on June 6 $14.85 on an old CC I am ready to cancel that Netflix still has the number for from 3 years ago! I IM them and ask what's up. WAIT FOR IT! THE TOTAL BS! Apparently, my husband logged in via iPhone while on a break before work to watch his show while the kids were watching Sofia the First at home. The horror! That now up's your bill automatically to the ""STANDARD PLAN"" of $14.85. Gift card runs out. And I am charged. I AM DEAD SERIOUS. Nasty customer service folks -- 3 of them -- refused to do anything. They took off the $14.85 but canceled out my gift card. So I paid $25 for less than 2 months and husband loses the gift I intended. They actually wanted $39.85 for less than 2 months. All because he logged in on an iPhone when kids were watching the same time. This is ludicrous. They could have in good faith credited me and let me use the gift card. Nasty, nasty customer service.

Stellar customer service there Netflix. He also said I couldn't share. I never asked about sharing. I didn't realise using my own Netflix myself was sharing. I am one person. I can't hide my own password from myself when I travel. I don't morph into another person when I get on a plane. Also not being able to use the service at all when travelling is rubbish.

Must take its toll to be working for a company you know has not got a decent product.Sometimes they have some good series or movies. But everything around it sucks. When you navigate on NF it feels like when you are going into these supermarkets where they make you get lost in a maze of 200 yards of corridors just to get at pint of milk.

They were only able to refund us for this month and we were advised to go to the bank for a further refund. The scary part is we were also advised that when you cancel you have to specifically tell them to remove your card as they keep your profile for 10 months so it can be restarted at any time.

Yes, the most recent cancellation was the straw that broke the camel’s back but it’s been a long time coming. The race to binge watch seasons worth of content in hopes of defying the cancellation curse is exhausting and has taken the joy out of the watching experience. If a series isn’t deemed worthy of promotional backing and doesn’t pull exceptional numbers right after release, it is immediately in danger.

So in the end they shortened my subscription from a month to 2 weeks because they didn't want to upgrade me on a goodwill I even requested at this point that I pay them the £2 for the sake of arguments but they sooner refund me than upgrade me. A very greedy company who makes billions yet dont care about customer services im never going to take out a subscription with them and on top of that apparently they don't have a complaints department which legally every company should have.

NO REFUNDSIf they mess up and charge you 2 or 3 times a month as they did withy me. They have NO complaints process, no way to get the money back. they have a policy even on accounts never watched or logged in to that they will only refund max of 6 payments. If you want all of your money back taken without your consent, You must report to the Police, take them to court or file chargebacks through your bank and wait few months to resolveRepoting to your bank takes a ton of time and effort, they will cancel your cards and issue new ones that then you must update on all monthly bills you have linked to your old card.NETFLIX are saving a lot of money by not paying for a large complaints department and are relying on most people giving up chasing for money taken without consent. A win-win for NETFLIX they keep money taken without consent and have no complaints department to payout forLeaving myself and thousands of others out of pocket and very angry after years of being loyal. Looking online there has been many cases of this published in the national British NEWSPAPER The Guardian going back as fare as 2019But they are still doing the same thing with people's cards and refusing to refund so you have been warned and if i ever get my money back I will up date this review.",1,Trustpilot,CZ,

Instead to save them money they pass you off saying they can only refund max 6 payments if you want more or have other complaints you must go to your bank!!!Not only does this save netflix having to staff a complaints department that I am sure would be very busy.They also can hope large amount of people will give up and not bother claiming through the bank. leaving netflix to pocket the stolen money taken with out customers consent and not having to pay to staff a complaints procedureVery very dirty trick and more than likely why they are losing thousands of customers and have 51% negative 1* ratingI am so angry at how much money I have given netlix for years and now I have a problem as they where taking 2 or 3 payments a month when we was not even watching netflix is simply shockingSO If you cancel with them check your bank as I have seen reports going back 3 and 4 years where they have been running this scam 0of taking 2 or 3 payments a month then refusing refunds in fullAs well as people cancel but NETFLIX keep all your personal details and card details for 10 months after you cancel, open an app or do anything they start billing again. Sop many dirty tricks to keep taking money then brick walls when it comes to complaints and rerfundsSHOCKED such large company can play such a dirty game and will never ever have anything to do with them and will up date this when I do get full refund if I have to go through police courts or what ever I will recover every penny and will make sure to make public what they are doing to help others see they are not alone in the NETFLIX SCAM operation",1,Trustpilot,CZ,

2022-12-09,"Netflix doesn't care about user personal/CC info getting stolen, and their Customer Service hung up on me","I spoke to an extremely rude and unhelpful customer service team tonight regarding getting fraudulently charged for the month of Oct and Nov due to someone creating a fake account under a different email address, and was using my card info on file for the second time in a row (the first call I made to Customer Service was in Oct '22 to end my account membership because of this same issue and then I got charged AGAIN for Oct and Nov '22 by a hacker outside of the US being able to still use my card and create a new account w/ an email address I don't have access to, same thing they did the first time around).Prior to the customer service team's 'supervisor' hanging up on me and not reimbursing for what I should have never been charged with towards the end Oct/Nov (since I had literally called them all earlier the month of Oct to alert them about the unusual charges with the same card); I requested to be sent information regarding devices that have been logging in with my card info since this other user had created a NEW account after I initially called customer service just a month and a half before (again, using a different email address I don't have access to from outside of the US). Instead of sending me this information, customer service gave me an email address to their privacy dept before hanging up on me mid-sentence. This email address doesn't respond to customer service claims according to the bounce back message I received, so I was frsutrated to say the least that I was given the run around regarding information I'm legally entitled to to file a fraud claim with my bank.The first customer service rep I spoke to back in Oct never gave me the option to completely block my card from being able to be used in the system again, which was an option offered to me tonight. Had she done this to begin with I would not have had to call customer service back a month and a half later with the same issue.Due to the incompetence I experienced by every person spoken to on the phone in regards to something as serious as users' personal/confidential info being so easily accessible to others I won't stream with Netflix again. They are by no means a monopoly on streaming service, are headed in the toilet compared to their streaming competitors, and it's of no use to stream with them if they're so flippant about Customer Trust/Service, and Security breaches.",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-12-01,Horrible. Unsubscribed almost a year ago. Never going back.,"Netflix used to be the BEST streaming service. Generally speaking, their servers are the quickest and the user interface is the friendliest out of all that I used (HBO Max, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, etc.) But their content is straight up trash. I respect anyone who wants to disagree, but as a younger millennial (currently in my early 30s), Netflix's agenda of pushing their woke content is becoming ridiculous.First they took away their review system and star ratings years back when I used to use them. That was helpful on what I could watch. Now, they don't provide that option. Then they had the thumbs up/down and they ditched that too. So everyday, they want to push their own crappy content to you and their endless amount of TV shows. If you pause something you're watching, a screen saver comes up with more pushy content. I did not pay for this crap.They don't even tell you what movies are foreign and don't make it clear what languages are default so when you start playing, you realize you have to watch subtitles. I'm ok with reading subtitles but not everyone is and it's not always convenient. Then, some of the dubbed content works but most don't so watching it takes away from the actors/actresses' true intentions/speech. It's not the same. A great example is Alice in Borderlands.Their synopsis writing for their selection is terrible. The synopsis doesn't tell you anything about the movie until you actually watch it and waste your time on some stupid story. A lot of them are also poorly written and don't make sense grammatically which is shocking for a billion-dollar company. Then, because you can't find out what the movie is about or get an idea from other users/ratings, you have to look it up yourself or end up wasting your time watching their pushed content. They also have some of shuffle feature which shuffles their Netflix original and pushes it onto you.To add insult, they have the audacity to raise their subscription prices when they have absolutely no content. Unless you want to turn something on for background noise or waste your time laughing at how bad a lot of their content on, don't even bother. I unsubscribed almost a year ago and never looked back and I don't miss Netflix at all. I also cancelled Hulu for the same reason and I'm aiming to canceling Prime Video too. Don't let these media companies control you.FYI: if it weren't for The Witcher (which I heard they're about to butcher also), 1899 (update: they cancelled this) and the Jeffrey Dahmer limited series as of late, this company would have nothing to hang on.",1,Trustpilot,US,
