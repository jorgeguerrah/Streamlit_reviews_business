2023-01-18,I have been harassed by,"I have been harassed by employees, shoppers and drivers repeatedly at the Wilton, NY Walmart. It is otherwise a nicer Walmart, so I am sorry they do not have better control over their store environment and ethics of the employees. I have had people approach me and say lewd things, and comment on my clothing, etc. **. One guy in electronics literally started a harassing conversation with me where he was grinning and joking, while talking about knowing a veteran who died from suicide. He is grinning and laughing while talking about this subject in an unsolicited conversation with me. On the same trip, as I entered a section of the store, someone else started making loud joking ""vomit"" noises (for an extended period of time) in the aisle I was entering. It really left me feeling that this place is a disgrace. The prices are not even that much cheaper than smaller stores at this point, so I'm going elsewhere. Walmart needs to clean things up.",1,Consumeraffairs,,NY
2022-09-24,Don’t purchase electronics or any,"Don’t purchase electronics or any large purchase at Walmart like a computer, tablet or anything else above $50.00. I purchased a Gateway computer on July 22, today -Sept 24, 2022- it started having problems. I boxed it up and took it back to Walmart. She said their return window so 15 days. 15 days!? What’s that? And, had the option to purchase a warranty had been offered, I would have purchased it like I typically do. The option wasn’t there so I can’t purchase something that wasn’t offered. I’ve been on hold with Gateway, for over an hour. I’ve learned my lesson, NEVER again will I purchase ANY type of electronics from Walmart or buy the Gateway brand again.",1,Consumeraffairs,,TX

Whenever you use a credit or debit card or bank card at any Walmart They will automatically charge you $12.95 to join a club that is per month without your permission. When contacting Bentonville, I was told I had to get my bank on the phone and get them on the phone. This is ridiculous. There is no way that can happen. Keep checking your accounts. They got me twice.",1,Consumeraffairs,,OK
2022-08-09,I made a subscription account,"I made a subscription account with my name then changed it to my friend's name so I could send it to them as a gift. However, since Walmart did not send out the package with my friend’s name it did not get delivered to their apartment. The tracking service says it was sent back to Walmart, but when I contacted them about it they said they don’t take the packages back. So where did it go? They will not send it back with the correct name (that I changed a day later) and they want me to pay for another box to be sent. So my first box is just lost? I love Walmart and am very disappointed by this experience.",1,Consumeraffairs,,MD

2022-04-17,Walmart insists on sending small,"Walmart insists on sending small items one at at time via Door Dash even when I don't want them to. To make matters worse, Walmart does not supply the Door Dash driver with my complete address even though they have it. I have a Door Dash account, but Door Dash does not supply it to the driver, either. As a result, I have not received many orders, or as in one case, the Door Dash driver left an expensive electronic at a vacant house because Walmart will not give Door Dash drivers my house number. How on earth does Walmart expect anyone to deliver an item with only a street address and no house number. Repeated contact with Walmart and Door Dash does not seem to correct this. This just happened to me again today. I am going back to boycotting Walmart. Should have never started shopping with them again. This is the most stupid problem I can think of. All Walmart has to do is give the Door Dash driver my house number. Seems so simple. Right? I guess not for Walmart.",1,Consumeraffairs,,OH
2021-12-11,I subscribed to Walmart's Beauty,"I subscribed to Walmart's Beauty Box Subscription for a few months when it was $5 a box. It was far from impressive but a fun surprise for only $5.

All of a sudden on 11/22/21, there is a charge on my AMEX for Walmart/Brandshare for $ 7.98 that I never authorized. Found my password and signed in to the Beauty Box website and there is no way to see the credit card information in order to delete it. Thank God for AMEX who is helping me dispute the charge and has issued a block on Walmart to charge my card.",1,Consumeraffairs,,FL
2021-10-12,The employees do not speak,"The employees do not speak English and do not seem to want to help because they do not understand English. In the future, I will go out of my way, so I do not have to shop at Walmart. I wonder if they are hiring illegals. If there are hiring Americans, they are so uneducated; they cannot speak English. The store reminded me of Kmart before they closed.",1,Consumeraffairs,,AZ
2021-06-14,They say they send you,"They say they send you full size items since the price increase from $5 to $6.98. This has found to be not true. I just received my 2021 spring/ summer box after fighting for them (brandshare) to send to me. The items were ALL samples with the exception of one item an overnight face skin mask. So if you think you're getting full size items, wrong. Since they changed their price there service has been terrible and not worth the amount you pay OR what they show that you will be getting. So... beware... too good to be true. My account after years is now cancelled.",1,Consumeraffairs,,NY
2021-06-13,Ugh! I used to love,"Ugh! I used to love it when it was $5 but now that the prices have raised; the products have gotten so much worse! The box I received today had nothing to do with me. I have curly hair and received a smoothing set for straight hair, men’s shave cream, Listerine tabs (I’m a severe asthmatic) a lipstick in hot pink, and a teeny tiny sunscreen that I kept for emergencies. I gave away all but 1 product. If you’re going to charge a premium price, at least pay attention to people’s profiles. I’m canceling future boxes.",2,Consumeraffairs,,NV

2021-01-30,I have received many Walmart,"I have received many Walmart Beauty Boxes over the past years, but without doubt the last box I received for the Winter Season 2020 has to be the worst ever! It seems like the actual products offered are becoming less and less. I would like to suggest adding more products and less coupons! When the decisions are made to put items in the boxes, they should offer more beauty products such as makeup, nail polish, perfume, etc., not hand sanitizer, toothpaste (even though I do like the samples), arthritis creams and so on. This is called a beauty box, make it about things to make women feel and look beautiful!",3,Consumeraffairs,,TN
2020-12-11,I recently purchased a Fingertip,I recently purchased a Fingertip Pulse Oximeter Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor Finger Pulse Oximeter SPO2 Pulse Oximeter from Walmart.com. The product sold by Wango does not work. I have sent numerous emails to both Wango and Walmart with videos of the product not working. I want to return the product and get a complete refund. I have not received any solution for the past 1+ months. The customer service is truly pathetic.,1,Consumeraffairs,,GA
2020-11-06,When I received the latest,When I received the latest Wal-Mart beauty box it was missing 4 items. I sent an email and was told several days later that not all boxes have the same amount of products. The booklet in the box shows 7 products I received 3. Obviously this was a mistake and easily corrected. Since I was dismissed and there's no way to speak to anyone I cancelled my subscription. Every box I've received has all of the products shown in the booklet in the box. I was lied to and that's inexcusable.,1,Consumeraffairs,,IN
2020-10-23,I didn't have high standards,"I didn't have high standards mind you, going in to the the Walmart Beauty Box. It was samples after all that they send based on the questionnaire you fill out at sign up. I was looking forward to seeing what they sent. That's when I got rather disappointed. They sent me items I'd never use, which is ok I've got sisters. I mean I'm the youngest at 40, but who cares right. Then there were items that did not exist at all! I looked up a few YouTube videos of women opening their boxes and they had roughly a half dozen samples. Why then did I get 4?! I mean the box was five bucks so it's not like I spent a lot but I got this little pamphlet that showed samples that I did not have... Um I must say that's just wrong. I went to take the survey and it kept asking me questions about the things I tried. That I did NOT try. I don't know. It doesn't seem to be the general consensus but I'm not sure I'm going continue. It was just sloppy and incomplete.",3,Consumeraffairs,,VA

2020-05-29,I consulted my wife on,"I consulted my wife on this. He had previously used Birchbox but last August, 2019, decided to switch because monthly was too much product to justify the price. All deliveries have been on time and we've never had to talk to customer service. The cost breaks down to about $1 per item. All of the items I've thought to notice while shopping in WM have indeed been sold at WM. Personally, I cannot tell the difference between middle and upper middle or lower middle beauty products, but my man tells me that the WM products will suffice for 99% of his needs. Ok. I've tried the lip balm once or twice. He seems happy with it. He runs out of the product he uses and we just gift the stuff he doesn't to friends and fam.",5,Consumeraffairs,,FL
2020-05-28,I don't mind the $5,"I don't mind the $5 shipping for the sample beauty box bc it's fair. I also don't mind that there are less items than when it 1st started years ago. The thing that irks me to no end is when you go to cancel the subscription, you can't log in to your own account. Error message even after resetting password AND emailing the company through the reply service provided in the confirmation email, apparently, the only way to contact this company. I'm not even sure it's legitimately associated with Walmart. If it is, then they're all up to no good. I was just testing the service with a cancellation request to see if it would let me & sure enough, they won't let me log in, much less cancel. It's only been a few days yet, but most companies reply right away to at least let you know someone is on it. Nothing at all! ",1,Consumeraffairs,,FL

2020-05-19,The beauty box was mostly,"The beauty box was mostly sample packets of some products I had never used. In my opinion, the sample sizes were not enough to make a determination on whether I would commit to the full size purchase(s) because the brand names were often expensive, like ROC. There were some boxes that included full size mascara or lip gloss but I was more interested in the skin care products and they were lacking in size and quantity. The box is a good value for sample and trial packets; don't expect much every time but you can sometimes find a surprise or two when you open it.",3,Consumeraffairs,,WV

Next on May 4th I received a shipping text message stating my package would be delivered by 8 pm that day. I received nothing. When I pulled up tracking info, it stated package was in Chicago. Weird I'm in Tennessee. Now tracking says nothing other than ""Your package is in our USPS Network."" It's been well over 30 days and I am out the money and the product. Being I couldn't get any info on the website, I went to a WalMart store in which they told me they have nothing to do with it, I would have contact the website itself.

Easy to find the products online or in-store should you like the sample. Sometimes, the items are full-size - especially lip & eye cosmetics. Always nicely boxed and sometimes includes a small cosmetics bag. There is a beauty profile you can fill out. CONS: The beauty profile is not always followed & you might get a weird makeup shade. There sometimes repeat items (not always a bad thing). The shipping seems out of sync with the seasons. (My Autumn box arrived at the end of December.)

They sent an organic protein and collagen sample that I will be purchasing. Loved the charcoal mask, dry shampoo and wonderful Hello toothpaste. Granted a few items are sample size but that just fills my travel bag nicely. The eyebrow kit was full size and came with a highlighter and sharpener.

My order was never fulfilled and I just kept going round and round with them. This was supposed to be a gift for my boyfriend. So finally after numerous attempts of trying to find out why my order hasn't been fulfilled after they charged my credit card way back in August they finally sent me the Men's Grooming box which was nothing like what was pictured and listed as what I would get for items. I understood you were supposed to get 3 full size items and 3 sample size items. I only got 4 items in total and the four items that I received were the same items that I got in the previous Men's Grooming box. ,1,Consumeraffairs,,MA

After a couple of months waiting I contacted them and was told I would get a refund for my troubles and still get the box as well... Still waiting. I asked about it and was told a completely different story than what the other rep had told me and that I was wrong so I went back through emails and sent them the email where it said the above and was still told different.

The lip balm alone was worth the $5 I paid for the box. The next box, while not as fancy, it was after the holidays and on to the Spring Box, was ok, but there was only one thing I would call beauty in it and that was a tiny, itty bitty, out of date sample of a well known anti-wrinkle serum. Everything else was toothpaste, floss, underarm deodorant, shampoo and conditioner samples, nothing that I call beauty samples, but worth $5. ",3,Consumeraffairs,,CA

I liked the packaging the box came in and how quickly I got the box. I liked the eyeshadow and lip colors provided. It made me feel pretty Plus the product met my needs. However it needed a little more variety. I would have liked some more skin care products. I would have also liked better foundation.

It was a company I trust and whose products I also trust. It was also very inexpensive. The variety of products contained in the box was a big plus. It was advantageous to receive many of the same brand and quality items that I already buy from their stores. I was pleased with what I received and it was equitable to the price, but getting more of a variety would've been appreciated.",5,Consumeraffairs,,AR
2017-08-03,Some items too low quality,Some items too low quality for price paid. Would rather see high quality products for a small increase in price than having a bunch of Dollar products that I won't use. I should be able to choose an area I would like to have makeup for and the box should be custom to my preferences. I get face cream and masks every month. I like getting random items however they should be random in an area I approve of. It would also be nice if the box included one or two items that everyone uses all the time. Something like Chapstick or blush or eyeliner in every box that gets sent out. That way I feel like I can gamble on what products I get because I will always get something that will always be useful. ,4,Consumeraffairs,,VA

I like various things that come In the Walmart Beauty Box, lipstick is my favorite and eye liner is my second favorite. They come in different colors also very durable for a low price product. The products in the box are very good for its low price, but the box doesn't promote well with the products on the inside. It's not fashionable and it downgrades the product in the box.",3,Consumeraffairs,,CT

It was nice to have it delivered to my house so I didn't have to go to the store and it made me try different things that I would not have usually tried. I liked that this product was from a brand that I trust and that I rely on on a weekly basis and that it offered a variety of different products and that I could try different things. I would have preferred a more high quality products included into the box but for the money that this was it was worth it. I would just chose a different one for next time.,5,Consumeraffairs,,PA

Nothing broken or missing. I also liked the introductory letter I receive. It was like they really knew me as a person and I appreciated it so much. I was very happy with the products as well. I didn't think I would like this kind of service but I do. If anything, I would started doing this service months if not years ago. But I'm happy regardless.

Not many other websites can provide for what I want and/or need. However, the overall look and design of the Walmart beauty box could be very much improved for the personal likings of the individual customers. The price should be slightly lower as well because the products being sold are makeup and makeup doesn't last forever. But I very much like how much you can get, the price for it all, the variety of choices and many, many shades. They have what I want, and I know that so why would I want to go anywhere else?",5,Consumeraffairs,,MI

I like that you get a wide assortment of beauty products and that the Walmart beauty box is cheaper than most beauty boxes with good items in them and not just sample size but regular sizes as well. But it would be nice to experience different types of boxes that come with different items each month with different things to try out to see if you like so you can purchase them if you liked them. I would like it better though if I had more options to choose other beauty boxes with more sample and regular size along with the sample size.,3,Consumeraffairs,,TX
2017-07-23,I like the price of,I like the price of this Walmart Beauty Box. For the amount of things you are getting for just $5 there is no way for the price to be beaten. There is so many different items for this value 6-8 and I like trying different brands and products and at $5 you really cannot complain. The value is definitely well over the cost. I love the Walmart Beauty Box. But as this is quarterly I feel like I wait forever for my new box to come out. I would change how often it comes out. Also they have a lot of the same brands like I might get Farrier shampoo one quarter and then the next quarter another version of Garnish shampoo. The same with Dove and Olay and I like to change up brands. Seem to be a lot of repeats.,5,Consumeraffairs,,FL
2017-07-22,I chose this beauty box,"I chose this beauty box over the others mainly because of the price and the selection of products. Most are brands I know and like. There are certain high end products I like, but overall, the things you can find at Walmart and other discount stores are decent as well. Being able to choose from so many things was nice and I felt encouraged to try some things I've never tried before. Ordering it was a fun and easy process. I received some nail polishes and lip glosses that were different than nothing I would have normally bought. The only thing I would do differently when ordering one again is to be more adventurous in products I order. I feel like that's part of why I did something like this.",5,Consumeraffairs,,IA
2017-07-21,I chose the Walmart Beauty,I chose the Walmart Beauty Box firstly for the price. You can't beat a $5 box. A dislike for me however would be how quickly they sell out! I had to try a few times before I got in on the box which frustrated me. Sometimes I'm unsure of when billing will happen so I just randomly see the charge and remember that it's coming up. I wish they would send more of a notification for when the billing and shipping will happen each quarter. But I like the fact that the Walmart box is quarterly so I don't have to feel rushed using the products in a month. The packaging is also sleek and trendy. It is packaged well and I've never had any damaged products. ,5,Consumeraffairs,,IN
2017-07-20,It was priced decently well,It was priced decently well but it could be cheaper. But I like the amount I got for the money. The value was good. Everything included was pretty much what I needed. I could not wait to use it. I enjoyed using the products I got from the box and good choice in colors. The things that came with it were proficient for usage too. One thing I disliked however it could have included makeup remover or eyelash curler. The mascara left residue and it could be a little more indulgent on the eye makeup as well. But overall it was great.,3,Consumeraffairs,,AZ

It's okay though because it got here quickly and was convenient for me. I had received 5 products that I proceeded to use immediately. Inside was hand cream, Q-tips, dry shampoo, eye shadow and hand sanitizer. I was expecting a little more but overall pretty cool box. Walmart Beauty Box was affordable and I liked that fact that I could order it online without going out to the actual house. But I would change the fact that it looked so plain and that I had some random things in my box. I'm a huge fan of sparkly objects and I was hoping this box would be sparkly.",3,Consumeraffairs,,NV

Last time the vender gave me half the price of the item I ordered instead of a full refund. If the vender doesn’t want to refund, I am guessing, I will have to wait until the product actually arrives. This is a very bad way to do business, says me. Items should be guaranteed a full return.

Act with integrity? Respect for the individual? Walmart is more like low paid actors pretending to be there to service the community and make a profit on selling groceries. I worked for the company for 7 years. I worked in a dozen different locations- remodeled stores- and I have been in management roles most of that time. In that time I have seen Walmart in and out and they have a lot to hide. I was told to get my white a** outside for asking an hourly team lead where to put freight and when he became hostile I called my manager and did the proper procedure to handle the situation. I was told I could forget about it or go to another store and then terminated for speaking up. Since this incident the APASM has fled to another store to stay under the radar and Walmart never reached out to see if I was okay. Since then I’ve been in and out the hospital and I have suffered a heart attack. This company lacks the empathy to have associates when the only drive is to raise wages and bully the associates and if an associate raises a care or concern they are terminated. Thank you,1,Trustpilot,US,

I knew exactly how much monet I had as I was paid $200 from person just 10 minutes before I got to the store and $150 from another at the store. I called it to the attention of the person working the self check out but she didn't seem to understand. I explained to a manager what had happened he opend the cash box. He really didn't count the money or check too much but it show an error had occured. I showed him when I add the purchase I made to the money in my pocket I was $50 short. He was confused a little because he tried twice to give me $100 back. I was honest and told him NO. Just $50.

I took it to Walmart and struggled to get it in a cart as it was very heavy for me. I went to service desk and the manager came and said it has gas in it.I told him I got it out. He looked and since it was tilted in the cart it accumulated about a shot glass size of gas. He said get it out. I asked him how and he said leave it running. I told him it wouldn't start and that's why I am returning it. He said no gas in the store. I told him I shouldn't have to be lugging this snowblower back and forth at my age (hence the reason for ordering on line). He walked away from me.

2023-01-18,Mixed Results,"I have placed many orders at Walmart.com and have had mostly good experiences. One exception was with an order that the Walmart website failed to inform me would be delivered from a local store. After experiencing a problem, local delivery is magically no longer available to my address. Problem solved. Unfortunately, the latest issue I've had seems to be intractable. Cans of food that I order are consistently damaged. These are very strong steel cans, that are not damaged easily. The damage has occurred with orders shipped from multiple Walmart distribution centers, so this is a systemic problem. Replacement items even arrive severely damaged, well-packed in undamaged shipping boxes. Walmart keeps doing the same thing over and over, while expecting a different result. If Walmart would just offer canned food by the case, this problem would not occur. When I order this same product from a competitor that sells it by the case, it is never damaged. Unfortunately, the competitor didn't have it in stock the last time I needed it, so I had to order it from Walmart.

It gave me a bar code to show the store said all we had to do was show the bar code to customer service (It is that easy). We spent 45 minutes trying to return this item.

We arrived early and checked in and went shopping in the store after being told it would take less than an hour, no problem.  After 30 minutes we were called back to the counter and told that they did not have the right socket for the nuts on the wheel.  They did have a 13mm and a 15mm but not the 14mm needed.  To help and expedite the problem, they couldn’t change the tires otherwise, I offered to drive do the nearest AutoParts store and buy them a 14mm socket.  When I came back and presented the socket, I was told they were only allowed to use Walmart approved sockets, and could not use the one I had handed them.  Brilliant, I asked them why they did not tell me this before I left, they replied that they were going to. When? After they had buzzed the door out, maybe?  At this point I headed for the Customer Service desk and asked for the Store Manager who I was told was “not in today”.  In the end I had to explain my story three times to hourly staff who were ‘very sorry’.  The last one said he would look for “a salaried member of staff” and left me waiting for half an hour.  I called the main Walmart Customer Service number and was put through to a very pleasant lady who took all my details and then I told my story once again.  She told me that there was ALWAYS a manager on hand at all stores during business hours and promised to escalate the problem and I would be contacted with a resolution promptly.  In the meantime the Tire department ‘manager’ had found the missing 14mm socket and the tires got changed. He made a big deal of taking off the tire protection package which we had already said we didn’t want.  We eventually left the store after over 2 hours. This was some five days ago and there has been no contact.  Maybe I have answered my original question, they don’t care.

2023-01-28,Walmart will be held accountable for making bias claims! I wouldn’t even leave one star,"I wouldn’t even leave one star. I made a purchase online which was delivered by the store in Greeneville TN to my home. The delivery was over 8 hours late to start with. I decided to return the item. $33.04 was used on a Walmart Gift Card and the rest was purchased using my debit card. I started the return online and when I went to the store to return it with the receipt barcode, the employee told me the whole amount would be placed on a Walmart giftcard. Which is absurd. Walmart’s own return policy clearly states original form of payment is refunded with the receipt. It was well within the 30 days as I had until the 31st of January which the app clearly shown. My attempt to return was the 26th of January. I go online to chat with a representative explaining this and they told me refunds did go on original payments but supposedly my order was already refunded and they refused payment back to me. Apparently, they do not like accountability and I got an email stating my online account was closed. That’s very retaliatory when I did nothing wrong yet they did and when caught decided I’d just go away if they deleted the account. But, per the email, I can shop in store as often as I like.??? I have a right to speak and I stated facts like the fact I would file with the FTC and several other agencies. Walmart is no dictatorship nor can they just decide to give me a gift card so I won’t spend my money elsewhere. They broke their own return policy. And, they imply fraud from me when I actually follow their policy and try and create a return with receipt legally…that’s an insult to my character and totally unfounded bias because I called them out on corruption, fraud and illegal practices. Now their CEO talked about closing stores due to theft problems in December 2022. But, what’s the difference between that and Walmart making millions from fraud schemes with their money centers stealing millions from people using that service. The FTC has sued them just due fraud!!!

Now I know the bank can't release a hold another company has on my money.  Now is day 5 and the hold is still on my money. Called again and I was told the Hold would be released on January 3rd.

The reason I chose to have it delivered was so I didn't have to drive 10 miles to get it and go through the hassle of parking, finding it and the other items I wanted in the store, checking out with clerks who are not paid to be nice to customers, and then lugging it home.  It was delivered today.  The trash can is the correct one, but the lid is not for that trash can.  I ordered a step-on trash can and the lid I received is for a swing trash can, which will not work. Whoever picked it up at the store didn't bother to see if the can and lid matched.  SO I have now tried to talk to two ""customer service"" reps, neither or whom have English as their first language and were extremely difficult to understand.  I wanted it to be picked up and the correct unit delivered.  That is not too much to ask for the carelessness of some Walmart employee.  Unfortunately, neither of these unhelpful ""customer service"" people were able to provide me with a label so it could be picked up.  So now I have to load the trash can in my car and drive about 8 miles in the other direction to the UPS store where they can scan the code.  To say that I am not happy about this experience is an understatement.  Customer service has never been a major part of Walmart's philosophy, and it seems rather non-existent now.

2023-02-04,Don't know why I'm even wasting my time…,"Don't know why I'm even wasting my time nothing ever is resolved with this money hungry highway robbing business. It's not a review of any one particular moment but in general each time I visit this pathetic store. There's never product availability unless it's 60 miles away, search for products in local store offers no clear information it's always shady such as the price. It will say if purchase online but what's the price if I get it in store. There's never clear location availability as it will give a location  then say delivery to that location  and a date, always only 2 maybe 3 registers open besides the self check out which all check outs have extreme lines to wait in. The prices are at an all time high even though consumers end up doing the jobs of the employees such as scanning and bagging our purchases on top of that paying ridiculously high costs only to travel miles home and cut open produce to find it is perished or to open a boxed frozen product to find the plastic bag is wide open inside the box while the actual food has not been freshly sealed for who knows how long that what is to be for consumer consumption is fully exposed regardless if it is in the box. Walmart reveals prices will continue to rise due to theft and oh this is funny and because of employee pay rates rising which is far from believable since there are no cashiers during any period throughout the working hours also accusing consumers of theft when everything is locked up, perhaps it is NOT the consumers stealing from the stores . Many businesses close their doors due to employee theft as it very common causing bankruptcy. Even while raking in billions per month walmart shows its true colors regarding how much they value the consumers that shop and continuously get ripped off by paying alot for low quality products not to mention the decrease in amount of product for the same price or higher. Most employees are part time which means ineligible for benefits. Can corporate honestly justify high pay rates to employees? Produce for the past month looks as though it was found outback of another grocery store that had discarded it, mostly near perished only to last a day after getting it home. With the economy the way its been consumers cannot afford the fuel it would take to make trips to and from returning such items so they don't it just goes into the trash. Where's the value in that? Wait, where's the value in any purchases made at walmart? Many consumers simply overlook and disregard these discrepancies but when exactly will ENOUGH BE ENOUGH? How much more abuse do we as ""valued consumers"" have to endure before realizing that's it! Walmart needs us more than we need walmart!!! We make those greedy retailers get richer while we as ""valued consumers"" suffer low quality products for completely ridiculously high prices. Walmart claims they are closing stores due to theft, and who ate they accusing ? So while walmart belittles ,diminishes,insults and makes such assumptions about its much needed consumers, claiming customer satisfaction is their goal taking our money knowing how poor the quality is. Think about how many times you may have complained about something then think about how many resolutions occurred or if your complaint made any kind of difference. Can't think of any times walmart actually replied to resolve an issue you had? Actions speak much louder dont they? This is the daily operation of walmart and its sickening though we sit and do nothing allowing this retail giant to continuously take total advantage of us ""valued consumers"". Remember when this company first started  and remember the man who started this company what his reasons were for starting this company? That man had the American consumers at heart because it was what he believed in .we always hear things like "" give back to the community"" . Just keep in mind that an empire doesn't build itself, consumers are responsible for building that empire and as consumers we have the potential not to mention the power to reverse all of that, so very many consumers say the same thing about this retail giant, how much longer will we only make these comments and be taken advantage of? Something to consider is who needs who the most? Face it the products made in China that walmart sells don't last needing replacement within only a couple of years if that how is that a great value? Products that have safety hazards brought to corporates attention that gets ignored and the item is discarded or never used again, or minor incidences occur on their premises that you file a report as it too is ignored, still believe you are a ""valued consumer"" or that ""customer satisfaction"" is walmarts goal?

She had called me once but I missed her phone call.

The first one being the incorrect address and the food that I lost and the second one being the proper address and the extra money I had to spend.Walmart did not hold up their end of the deal and refund our money they simply  ignored Me.

I use to go to this location for oil changes and had descent luck.  Not lately.  I had an oil change on my vehicle and they stripped the oil pan threads and I had to take it to another repair shop for corrective action.  Thankfully WM paid the bill to a tune of about $500 for a new oil pan.  Recently, I decided to give them another chance.  I drove my vehicle in for an oil change and was promptly advised that they are not doing oil changes at this time due to a shortage of trained technicians.  About a month later I went back with a different vehicle.  No vehicles were in any of the bays.  Was told the crew was going to lunch -- come back in an hour.

2023-01-27,Profit over Consumer,"I am using this forum to share my recent experience with Walmart.com’s Marketplace venue. Anyone taking the time and querying the BBB will find that Walmart is basically insulated from any regulatory accountability and since the customer complaints are individual cases they can basically be put down. I want to direct consumer attention to the Marketplace venue at Walmart.com. An article at CNN Business, Walmart’s online store isn’t profitable. How it’s borrowing from Amazon’s playbook, dated 5/4/2021, highlights Walmart’s focus in the wild west of Internet commerce. “Walmart’s online business isn’t profitable, and it can make more money from third-party sales than from selling its own merchandise online. Not only does the company collect commission fees from sellers, it can then upsell merchants on even more products: ads, delivery services or even lines of credit through a partnership with Goldman Sachs.”A consumer has to question the “quality” of the review process for entry into the Marketplace. It is asserted “Walmart, sellers are subjected to a process that includes a review of the products they sell, their sales history and previous product and seller reviews.”My experience challenges this assumption. The presentation selling web pages are far from clear in presentation or content. My observation cannot be applied universally to Walmart.com Internet sales activities but draw attention to consumer risk exposure in the Marketplace. Walmart appears to have no interest in providing assurance that the 3rd party vendor web page and narrative is both accurate and credible. There are significant differences in the Marketplace Return and Refund policies/procedures.

Please review the Marketplace Return Policy for more information.I tried returning to the local WM store based on web page comment re: returns within 30 days. This follows repeated attempts without success in reaching my Marketplace seller (sold & shipped by) through phone call and email. Store Customer Service stated not possible because it was purchased from 3rd party (sold & ship) and generated a 3”X3” register note that stated the customer “You can easily start your return on Walmart.com.” Wasted travel time and line wait time in excess of 1 hour.Return home and in an extended dialogue with on-line customer chat – frustrating at best.Order – WM stated could not return because it was not received. I advised this was incorrect and provided UPS Tracking # for the afternoon delivery. Return Process – advised could not initiate since order not delivered. I had to contact Marketplace seller. Advised all attempts failed. I was instructed to contact via web site.Message – I sent the vendor email through the system on 1/27/2023, date received, aborted store visit and on-line chat session.Reply email from Walmart - extract:We discovered a pricing error on some items in your order. We had to cancel them in accordance with our pricing policy.Don't worry - you weren't charged for these canceled items. Any temporary holds will be removed within 10 business days, in accordance with your bank's policy.What's next? We're working on correcting the issue on our end and updating the site. These items can be found in you purchase history if you'd like to place a new order.If you still have questions, you can learn more about cancelled orders. in our Help Center.I followed up in amazement trying to understand the WM time machine voiding a transaction that has been completed. WM did not want to address the vendor performance issue despite similar negative reviews.My issues and lack of review on offering, execution, delivery and communication was not addressed. It is interesting to note the same listing is in place at the same price!",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-12-26,Disgusting Customer Service,"Worst company ever! I placed a delivery order an entire day in advance. At the time it was supposed to arrive, there was no word, no communication, nothing. I reached out and was told it would be escalated and I would receive my order within the hour. Lies. I attempted to call the store and kept getting routed to the pharmacy and was finally hung up on. I waited two hours and reached out again. This time I was told my driver had arrived. Still nothing. Finally, I contacted Home Office and they said it was a problem with the third party delvery app and I could pick up my. order myself. They gave me a $15 coupon code. On the way out the door, I get an alert that my order was on the way. I wait and nothing. I tried to contact the driver multiple times and they did not answer and finally turned their phone off.  I then get a notification that my order was delivered, nothing was on my porch. A picture was available and it was not my porch in the picture. I contacted Walmart yet again and they processed a refund that will take DAYS to get back. I finally contacted customer service again to delete my entire account and they gave me push back. They told me I was a valued customer and offered another $15. I let them know I was not interested. It took 30 minutes for them to close my account. Throughout the day, I was lied to, hung up on, and even had a chat rep disconnect the chat on me while I was typing. I decided I am done with Walmart and will be using Kroger and amazon from now on.",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-12-22,Walmart+ Not Worth The Headaches!,"I have finally canceled my Walmart+ account after having been with them since the START of the program.  Here’s why:1-No matter when you place delivery orders, there are always items that are  unavailable — AND:    — They don’t let you know until about half an hour prior to delivery.    — If you drive to the store, those items are usually right there on the shelf.2-If your delivery order is over half an hour late, you will not receive it until SOMETIME the next day.  You get ONE text to say that your delivery is delayed, but that’s it — no further communication.  Which brings me to . . .3-Speaking to a human for customer service is virtually impossible.  When you get the right link to have someone call you back (usually an hour later), they are difficult to understand and offer plenty of apologies, but NEVER resolve your problem.4-Sure, they offer “up to” 10¢ off a gallon of gas, but until you get to the pump you never know how much or even IF there is a discount.  THEN, to get the discount you have to go through multiple steps on the app, wait for them to send you a code to enter at the pump — all prior to paying as you normally would, and if the cell service isn’t that great in the area … DON’T EVEN.5-Free shipping with no minimum USED to be the ONLY benefit, but no longer.  Items are increasingly “not available for shipping” or much higher than in-store pricing.  Same-day shipping is NON-EXISTENT.  6-Paramount Plus is hardly worth the $100 you dish out for the service.  No, thanks!7-Walmart pickup, although flawed at best, is the best service they offer and it’s FREE for everyone with a $35 minimum order (same as Walmart+).",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-10-13,I use Walmart.com all the time and…,"I use Walmart.com all the time and where I live first it was me and my family didn't want to get sick, so at fist we loved using Walmart.com until the store in Columbus, GA has got worse with the customer service to the point where when I order things the store pull what they want me and my family to have and when I do get my order it's wrong or not nowhere closet to what I order so I try to handle it with the store and the store put a refund in or I have to call customer service and they put in for a refund and this has been going on for 3 months and next thing I know as a Walmart+ customer my account was closed and its like i was never a customer at all, so my husband who has a different account because he has fish tanks and his man things he buy on his account and when Walmart.com closed my account and called me a thief and took my money we started using his account because we had to buy things for Christmas for our children and the things that we bought got delivered and two of the things that we bought had to be returned to the store and we did that and some of the stuff was never delivered at all and on Christmas morning my children woke up with little to nothing because what we order never came or was not what we order but its a great thing that our children understand what happen and now because he call and asked why did the Walmart app say that I returned one thing but not another and never received our money back for noting that was returned that closed his account and told him that if he wasn't disabled he could go to the store and nun of this would have happen to us and now we are being told that because you wont take what we give you or be ok with someone taken from you we will close your accounts and tell you that we have to be ok with being robbed and have people tell us that someone email me over and over or put us on hold for hours at a time and then when someone answer the phone and we say hello that people hang up the phone and still nothing is being done about the problem.

2023-01-15,Don't shop with Walmart.  Horrible customer service.,"On 12/20/2022 I ordered a MOOER RED TRUCK Combined Guitar Multi-Effect Pedal Processsor Overdrive Distortion Reverb WAY01.  I was charged a total of $281. plus some change for the item.  I ordered it for a Christmas gift but was advised it wouldn't be delivered until 01/12/2023.  I waited patiently although my son needs the item asap and my money is in Walmarts hands.  On 01/09/2023 I received notice that the item with the tracking number was delivered to our mailbox.  We were concerned because we didn't believe the time would fit in the mailbox.  When we retrieved the item it was a torn envelope the size of the shipping label with a tiny emory board inside.  I immediately contacted Walmart Customer Service and demanded my money back so my son could get what he needed and had been waiting on since Christmas by purchasing something locally.  I got the runaround and after about 1 1/2 hours I requested to speak to a supervisor.  After another 30 minutes on the phone I got an apology, a $25 gift card and a promise that I would be able to get a refund on Saturday the 14th because there was a window and because the delivery date fell between 01/09 and 01/12/2023 and because Walmart rules said I had to wait two additional days I would need to call on Saturday.  I waited one additional day and called today, Sunday, 01/15/2023.  Once again I got nothing but a runaround waiting considerably more time after two additional calls and a bunch of research.  The first person on todays call promised me a refund but said I'd have to wait 24-48 hours for the funds to be refunded.  (I'm sure Walmart prefers for the money to be in their account as long as possible rather than mine).  I asked for a confirmation and she said I'd get an email advising me of what she had stated.  I checked for the email and what it said was they were investigating where the item was and contacting the seller and I would hear from the seller in a couple of days.  So what she said was a lie.  I made actually two more calls because the first one just sat there, finally after the initial conversation I had to ask for another supervisor.  He was completely uncooperative and said I had to return the item first before I could get a refund. I said I wouldn't waste my time returning a one inch emory board, if I received the item and wanted my money back of course I would return it but not this total insult of a package.  I did offer to provide a photo of the label and item.  I also advised I was already promised a refund immediately and I believe they would have taken notes as all businesses I know take notes regarding calls.  He continued to insist he wouldn't give me a refund without returning the junk I received in spite of the promise previously made by a supervisor.  I would highly recommend that noone do business with Walmart in light of their horrible customer service, dishonest promises and crappy vendors.  I looked up the vendor and they had terrible reviews and I could only find reviews about clothing items, nothing musical or electronic.  They are past they delivery date and have zero right to be sitting on my money.  I am appalled by their behavior to say the least.",1,Trustpilot,US,
2023-01-12,DO NOT GET YOUR OIL CHANGED AT POULSBO WALMART,"I went to the Walmart auto center in Poulsbo, WA to get my oil changed. My car was completed and given back to me “ready to go”. When I started the car there was a red triangle on my dash, which on Toyotas this means something REALLY BAD is happening. I immediately returned inside the store and told them what was going on. They scrambled to find a manager. I went outside to get the oil techs. They drove my car back into the bay. At this time there is an obvious oil slick trail from bay to parking spot, in the spot, then back to the bay following my car. Chris the oil tech who drove my car out said he noticed the red triangle when driving it out. I’m not a mechanic, but I’m smart enough to know when there’s a red triangle, the car SHOULD NOT be driven. Instead of heeding that warning, Chris drove it out, and turned the car over to me as if it was finished.I proceeded to listen to Eric the actual tech who worked on my car, inspect my car from underneath. Eric yelled out “F$@&!!!! Go get 2 managers!!!” Eric came out from underneath the car. I asked him what they did wrong. Eric told me “they drove my car out of the bay, without putting an oil filter on. That’s why I told them to get 2 managers” At this point I’m livid over the potential destruction of my engine, caused by the skilled technicians at Poulsbo Walmart. A manager named Raef I believe, came and said they “fixed the problem” but refused to give me a written statement of the events, in case of future issues caused by their mistake. At that point I asked for another manager. I also called 1 800 Walmart.Jeff the manager came up. I asked if he was there to talk to me, which he said yes. I told him I was in the phone with Walmart, he responded with “what are they going to do for you” no apology, just a assurance that he WAS NOT going to give me a statement saying what I was asking. I understand now that a “claim” is Walmart policy, but instead of coming at me with an attitude and telling what you’re NOT going to do, you could have apologized first and foremost. Your employees almost potentially caused significant damage to my vehicle. I drive for Ubereats, almost 1000 miles a week. My car is EVERYTHING to me. You and your technicians almost destroyed it, and I’m getting attitude lol? I was a restaurant manager for over 15 years, and I completely know how to handle an employee’s mistake. Jeff couldn’t have handled it more poorly. Walmart of Poulsbo needs to retrain their management, and they’re oil technicians. This whole entire situation, shows their lack of simple understanding of how to do their jobs. Oil tech forgets filter, and drives car with big red triangle on dash, and managers forgets that apologies go further than attitude. I will never get my oil changed at Poulsbo Walmart again. I will also be sure to tell EVERYONE that will listen in kitsap county, why they should NEVER get their oil changed there as well. I may shop there again, because convenience is inevitably going to bring me in again. DO BETTER WALMART",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-12-22,"Lied to by Walmart chat rep, now 4yr old has nothing for Christmas!","So by this point in life I don’t expect much from Walmart, but I didn’t expect to be lied to, in writing after multiple issues with their online ordering. Now a 4yr old in Georgia has no Christmas, and surprise, Walmart doesn’t care! A little backstory, one of my friends back home from high school shamefully made a plea on Facebook for help getting her 4 year old Christmas. She also has a 17 yr old who said not to worry about him he understands and just wants his little brother to have something under the tree for Christmas cause it means more to him. Well I started with a general search for hot wheels racetracks, that led me to Walmart having a Jurassic World themed racetrack for a reasonable price that also allowed us to afford a present for the oldest as well. So I placed the order on Dec 19, their banner in yellow at the top of their website said if it was ordered by Dec 21, it would arrive in time for Christmas. So after placing the order I’m told the racetrack would be delivered the following day and the shirts for the 17 yr old on Wednesday. On Tuesday at midnight we were notified that the delivery was delayed and by Wednesday there was still no update.  So I went to chat who basically said that they could do nothing and agreed the best course of action was to cancel the order and reorder it for pickup. So we cancelled the delivery and reordered it for pickup. We were told it would be ready by 4:11pm and shortly after this time, we were told it was unavailable at a store that has enough stock per their website. So we were notified it could be shipped and arrive by Dec 29, which does nothing to get a 4 yr old at least 1 present for Christmas morning. So I went to chat. I also should have learned at this point but thought maybe they’d have some better options. I got the luck of chatting with Lavone. I explained the situation and how this gift was the only gift a 4 year old in Georgia would get, and asked about other options for getting this toy. Lavone empathized saying he had experienced Christmas with no gifts and how he assured me that if I allowed him to change it to delivery, it would be delivered despite the website estimating Dec 29. So I reluctantly agreed to let him set it for shipping. Fast forward to today, Dec 22, and this delivery was still preparing. I reach out to chat support to see what is going on and this time I speak with Miguel. Miguel had the duty of telling me that Lavone had lied and that this gift wouldn’t be delivered until after Christmas on Dec 29. So I asked what Walmart was going to do, after all had Lavone been truthful, I could have still had time to order a gift from somewhere else and now, 3 days before Christmas my options were very limited if any for making sure this kid had at least one gift on Christmas morning from Santa. But they didn’t extend me that favor and then Miguel basically said that he’d ensure Lavone was not allowed to work on the platform again but there was nothing they could do to help me get a gift to a 4yr old. A suggestion was for me to go to the store and buy it myself, this is after I told him I lived in Colorado and this gift was bought for someone in Georgia. So I was upset and asked for a manager, and I got the luck of Karl who was also less than helpful. He also refused to do anything to help beyond escalate the issue and have Lavone fired for lying to me. Walmart is to blame for a 4yr old not having a gift on Christmas morning and they don’t care. They have lost my business for good. The only way they will get the hint, is for enough of us to stop shopping there. They’ve let me down for the last time. Adding insult to injury, I went to their Facebook page to try and get some help. I posted the issue in the comments section of their last minute Christmas gift post. I was responded to and given a link to speaking to someone further. It was a Facebook messenger link that was a general contact form. I went through the form and listed my issue along with screenshots of the issues starting with the first delivery that never showed up, the pickup order that was available and then became unavailable, and all the chats I had with the agents. I was again told that it would be escalated but given no actual help. This entire thing has made me rethink what saving a few dollars means in relation to service and my sanity.",1,Trustpilot,US,
