2021-02-05,I went through the entire,"I went through the entire process with Tesla for solar on my home, even got the permitting complete. It took a few months of waiting for my install date and instead they just canceled my order completely saying they are no longer in my market. It was a complete waste of time and I have to start all over and find another company. Of course pricing has increased since then. I deeply regret ever trusting this company.",1,Bestcompany,,CA
2023-01-05,I decided to go with,"I decided to go with Tesla after a year of research, based on price, aesthetics, website information, etc.  I paid the deposit on September 29th, 2022 and the contract a week later.  I was told that permits were being applied for, but had to wait until November 30, 2022 for the initial site visit (60 days of 90) which went well.  

I was very clear how and where I wanted to be installed inside the garage and in the attic.  I was told that the 2018 home was solar ready, and plenty of room for the Powerwall inside the garage.  

The first design a week later seemed to confirm the same, but then it was unilaterally changed by Tesla's design team to outside the garage and house.  When I refused to agree to the same, they lied and said that the local city would not permit it.  
I contacted the city and found that both were entirely untrue.  J also found the added claimed equipment was not required and what was required costs between $60-100 dollars.

Then they raised the contract amount by $800 for the Powerwall garage installation, and another $625 for the 2018 solar ready attic and panel.  

 I went round and round with them for an explanation of the initial charges, and extra charges broken-down and still do not have that information, they refuse to provide it.  
Now Tesla has also wasted 80+ days of the original 90 days install date by lying, changing the design, stalling the site visit, not applying for permits, etc., 
They still have not given me any revised design, have not applied for any permits, have no installation date, and I will not be able to use the 30% tax credit this year.  

I cancelled the contract, and am waiting for a full refund of my $400 deposit.  Tesla is all smoke and mirrors, and then attempts to exhort extra fees, for their mistakes and lies. Too many red flags!  Heaven forbids if there are any other real problems, damage, production, installation, lack of permission to operate, etc.  

I will never do business with them, pay them any money, or buy their cars, and neither should anyone else.  They have all apparently adopted the personality of their principal, how unfortunate!",1,Bestcompany,,CA
2022-12-05,The price that Tesla offered,"The price that Tesla offered was great and the installation went smoothly, everything else has been a nightmare. No communications from my project advisor during the initial design phase, had to call Tesla numerous times to ask questions. Once installed, it took Tesla four times over seven months to file the application to the utility company correctly. Once utility approval was granted, found out that there was an issue with the system. It's now been four months with several visits from Tesla and they've been unable to fix it. I've had the panels on my roof for over a year now and they've never fully worked. I started a ticket with Tesla's resolution dept only for them to find out the approved utility application had incorrect kW amount, with very little help otherwise so far.",1,Bestcompany,,RI
2022-04-01,I finally went with the,"I finally went with the Tesla Solar Roof (tiles not panels) and I couldn't be happier. I needed a new roof anyway so decided to get it with 2 PowerWall backup batteries. The product looks amazing and IMO is the best looking solar product on the market right now. You cannot tell you have solar tiles at all. From a distance it looks like slate. Very smart. The install crew were amazing! They battled bad weather including freezing temps, rain, wind and snow in NJ in Feb/March! It did not deter them, and they got it done on time and were communicative the whole time. Shout out to Martin N & Jimmy C and their whole crew! Their electricians are also very detail oriented and do a great job of hiding things as best they can. The Powerwalls work seamlessly and the app showing usage is mesmerizing. You cannot tell when you are on battery versus, solar versus grid. No flickering, stuttering or anything. Just seamless power delivery. Highly impressive!

Some things to keep in mind:
I will say that Tesla's solar product line and what they do/do not support is changing by the minute, definitely get things clear with your project supervisor. For instance, I have 5 skylights and originally was told they would replace them for me. Then was told they don't do that service any more. But eventually they honored it because of when I originally put in my inquiry. 

Also their engineers will probably design the roof around protrusions without suggesting they be moved, as they don't want to handle the moving of them, such as vent pipes. So definitely suggest those things and get them taken care of by another roofing contractor before the install starts and it could mean more usable roof real estate.

I also got upgraded to the latest tiles that are a higher wattage, so the size of my system went up. It's bleeding edge tech and so is changing all the time.

So far, I have been very impressed with the people and the technology and would highly recommend Tesla Energy.",5,Bestcompany,,NJ

Tesla prepaired well and had 7 qualified professionals at the house . The installation was done very well and in one day which I would have never believed.
Very neat install very clean and good materials ... I’m very pleased with the Tesla panels which are performing well after 3 months .   In the dead of winter here in PA In February I’ve gotten up to 60% of rated capacity of panels indicating they are doing good .
I’ve already used the backup power wall which is seamless and very nice not having to drag out my old generator.

2022-02-05,We leased our solar power,We leased our solar power system from Solar City before the buyout from Tesla Solar. Transparent transfer from one company to the other. Excellent transaction throughout with great communication from install through activation. We had to deal with our local power company for the connection and turn-on but that was very smooth with assistance from Tesla (Solar City). We have been having connection problems with the wireless transmitter and it was actually detected by the monitoring department and they contacted us immediately and sent a technician out to fix the problem. I highly recommend Tesla Solar for any solar power install whether you purchase or lease the system. Thanks Tesla.,5,Bestcompany,,AZ
2022-09-03,I decided to go with,"I decided to go with Tesla for a couple of reasons. 1, they were the lowest priced. 2, they handle all aspects of the system themselves. From manufacturing or sourcing equipment, to installation, to financing. Seemed like a good idea. Everything up to and including the initial installation was flawless, except for the email + call + text (yes, all 3) every day for the 14 days leading up to the install date. After install is when the real problems started.
Prior to the City inspection, Tesla sent a tech to make sure everything was ready. He identified a couple of issues that could cause the inspection to fail. Tesla didn’t act upon this recommendation, and sure enough the inspection failed. Tesla came out to correct the issues, did so poorly, and the second inspection also failed. The system did pass on the third try. Wouldn’t be so bad, except I work from home. Every time Tesla had to come out, they turn my power off for however long. What they don’t tell you is someone needs to be home while the tech is there if any equipment is in the garage. So can’t work, and can’t go somewhere else to work.
System passed inspection 6/2. Tesla website says 1-6 weeks to complete the permission to operate application and have the new meter installed by your power company, unless delayed by the power company for some reason. In mid-June I received an email from my power company saying they were ready to proceed, waiting on the application from Tesla. I forwarded this to Tesla. Their reply is ‘we have 90 days to complete this application’. I called my power company and asked if this is true. The rep I spoke to said the remainder of the application is less than 100 keystrokes, but must be completed by Tesla, since they opened the application. *All attempts to get Tesla to tell me why it takes 90 days to complete the application have been met with ‘we have 90 days’ – nothing further.
Suddenly one day, my system stops working. The time was 12:00:00. Way too precise to be a coincidence in my book. I did the self-troubleshoot, to no avail. I turned the entire system off for a day to see if maybe it just got hot and needed to reset. No change. I called customer service, waited on hold, found out I don’t want customer service – I want Powerwall customer service. Called them. Went through the same troubleshoot process. Rep told me the system wasn’t communicating properly, and went into standby as an automatic safety precaution. We opened a service ticket, and she told me 7-14 calendar days for a service appointment. This was 7/15. No further communication from Tesla.
I started calling on 8/3 to ask about the missed 14-day threshold I was given. I was then told I would have to wait 20 business days (from 2 weeks to 4 weeks). When I asked why, I was told a tech would need to ping my system to see if they could reset it from the office (which is exactly what we did on 7/15). After 2 more days and 3 more calls / texts / chats, Tesla finally agreed to give me a service appointment. BUT- I would need to use the Tesla app to schedule it. My Tesla app doesn’t have the option to schedule service, so I had to call again. The rep sent a message to the scheduling dept, and I got a call within a couple of hours. My date is 8/25. Another 3 weeks. Again, no explanation why it takes so long.
I was told at one point that since I don’t have permission to operate, I was not a priority. I reminded them that this is because Tesla refuses to complete the application, not because of something I did or failed to do. It also isn’t because of the power company, who is sending me emails saying they are ready to go. No one I talk to is any help. I can’t get to a manager. I get random texts from Tesla that also don’t help. They did say they would move me up in the schedule if someone cancels. At 3 weeks for an appt, who’s going to cancel? At this point, my opinion is the appt for 8/25 should be for system removal, not service.",1,Bestcompany,,NV
2022-06-02,Tesla’s customer service is one,"Tesla’s customer service is one of the WORST I have ever experienced. Mr ELON MUSK  if you are reading this review you got to look into your customer service. It’s easy to criticize other people on your twitter feed as I have noticed. I bought a Tesla solar system for my house in dec 2021. I noticed in May 2022 that my system was not producing the kWh based on the system I installed. I contacted Tesla customer service via chat. I asked them to check regarding my system production. The chat agent mentioned everything was running great with my system after looking at my account. I have a 12.75 kw system and per Tesla customer service representative my system should produce 5-7 times my system. My Tesla app was only showing an average of 25 kWh production per day.

Over all the installation went well with the exception that they forgot the ""gateway"" this device that lets me and Tesla see what's going on with the system. Its equivalent to driving blind!  A week after the install I had to start calling the customer service department to find out what was going on. They knew nothing about the gateway not being installed and I was assured that this would be taken care of immediately.  5 more call all with the same empty promises and lies I was even given a fictitious FedEx #.  Every time I would ask to speak to a supervisor I would be put on a very lengthy hold then transferred to another customer service rep who could do nothing. There is a purposeful and deliberate stone wall preventing a customer from speaking to any upper level management at Tesla Solar. I have never received a call back from anyone in management, which tells me either the messages are never sent to them or they just don't care. Very, very  disappointing!  Also though I would add that for a company that is technically labeled a technology company how terrible there customer portal is. There have been issue after issue of the wrong information being displayed (very important contractual information) and I have brought it to their attention and been told they don't know how to fix it. This is completely unacceptable! I know It's not going to happen but I'll ask again anyway; I would very much appreciate a call from some one in upper management.

2021-02-05,My solar system was installed,"My solar system was installed by Solar City which was purchased by Tesla.  My rating of one star if focused on the support provided by Tesla.  I have had to replace at least two inverters.  Each time it takes a minimum of two months to be up and running again.  Getting confirmation about delivery dates or status requires multiple calls.  Often a return call or email is promised.  Sometimes that happens sometimes it does not.  I cannot comment on installation, which may be great.  The issue is that there are years ahead for service and that is not a pretty prospect.  
Each and every person I have talked to have been very pleasant and seem to try to assist me.   I question whether or not they have the kind of backup they need so that they can honestly deal with clients.  They must take a lot of grief from client clients if my experience is similar to others. 
There is some sort of compensation for the system not being able to deliver the power that was promised in the contract, but I doubt that it comes near the value of the lost production of energy.",1,Bestcompany,,","

2019-02-06,We currently have a lease,"We currently have a lease agreement with Solar City, which is now Tesla Solar. We loved our solar panels on our house we bought a few years ago, because we didn't have to put the solar panels in, they were already there when we bought it. We just had to take over the lease from the old owners. The solar panels saved us about 30% off our monthly bill. These were great savings, and we didn't have any problems with Solar City, until we moved... They told us at first that we could take the panels with us to our new home and it would be a flat fee of $495 for them to come get them and move them to our new home, then another flat fee of $495 for them to set them up on the new house. Then when we tried to get them to come do it, they kept changing the price. Pretty soon, they were saying it was going to be more like $7,000 to move them, and they also said the new house wasn't going to be able to have as many panels so they would prefer we leave them at the old one. The buyers didn't want them--so we had to hire someone to come take the panels off the house and fix the roof--which cost us $5,000, and we still have the panels sitting in our back yard at the new house waiting for someone to get back to us. Needless to say, it has been a nightmare. I'm not sure if we'll ever be able to recoup the cost, and we still have years left on the lease with Solar City--even though they won't send anyone out to put  the panels onto our new house. I loved the savings the solar panels offered, but feel like their customer service is CRAP.

After I started contacting utility company and questioned Tesla about no application being pending for my address, Tesla admitted to have not submitted any application.

When I inquired as to timing for the permission to operate (PTO) I was told (for the very first time) that Tesla was way backed up and could not even provide a firm date for when the PTO request would be submitted to PG&E (after which there will be a further PG&E delay). When pressed Tesla will say 60-90 days but this is not a promise. All of this is AFTER full payment for the system and all required paperwork has been filed by me. Tesla indicated they are short handed and have a big backlog but none of this was disclosed at the time I put my order in. Consumers beware. It is shameful that during time of power shortages, blackouts and shut offs due the fire risk that it is Tesla paperwork delays that are preventing more solar power on the grid.",1,Consumeraffairs,,CA

2023-01-29,Tesla mentally and financially hurts me,"This drama brand car is a lot more stressful than having a wrong boyfriend/girlfriend. I was so proud and excited to purchase a pre own 2018 Tesla model S without thinking and doing research carefully . I’ve experienced issues such as door handle (the most common one), brake pad, screen,  upgrades…I got a used one(34k miles) for 70k (way overpriced) and have driven for about 700 miles, door handle got stuck and it painfully cost me $425 to fix(my basic warranty expired). The major issue started when I reversed it and it made an incredible loud bang sound like metal slammed to metal, it was shocking. I immediately scheduled service appointment and they stated if they were going to take a look there would be a diagnose fee of couple hundred dollars therefore they only drove it and said my brake was absolutely normal, then it happened again, I brought it in for another service and again they confirmed nothing was wrong with my car. On 1/30/23, my Tesla was completely stuck, I couldn’t move forward or backward, something wrong with the drive unit/motor and it strongly stopped my car from moving, the tow company wanted $300 to tow it to the service center, I didn’t want to pay that much and I tried put more pressure on the accelerator to try to move it, my car was forcefully bouncing forth and back for 35 seconds and boom, that metal collapsed sound happened again I even had my son recorded to show them proof because they had never believed my story, I got blamed and excuses for all of the issues. The total of 5 unbelievable visits to SC for driving less than 1k miles. I treat this tesla like a baby, garage kept, haven’t drove in the rain, drive it very gently and routinely charge it. Anyway, I had to agree to the diagnose fee in order for them to open things up to take a glance . Finally they found something wrong with the brake and painfully charged me $800 but not guaranteed if that abnormal sound or car being stuck would happen again and I don’t know when it would act up (safety concerns). I had explained to them multiple times regarding the issues with the recorded video clip for proof and I still got blamed for not using my Tesla properly, they suggested me not to  let my car sit there for extended period of time (I haven’t done that, it’s been driven daily and they also blamed on the phenomenal issue, specifically occurred to my Tesla only. After reading all negative reviews, I strongly believed these reviews are true and honest. I have purchased many different brand cars and not a single/simple problem occurred whatsoever and even the old one with 200k miles wouldn’t hurt me badly like this Tesla S. I feel so regret that I couldn’t sell it because the price significantly dropped, hurting many tesla owners, some dealers already stopped buying or taking Tesla for a trade in, some offered me dirt cheap low for my Tesla model S, I’m now stuck with this poor quality car with constant issues and unpredictable ones unexpectedly coming anytime. It is a nightmare, a disease, a stress because it hurts me both mentally and financially. Tesla really need to do something seriously about all those complaints and concerns. Please treat consumers right, stop taking advantage of consumers, playing around with people trust and please stop taking  people hard work money. You guys need to lower the repair/maintenance/ ripped off fees or do something fairly for many bad luck buyers like me……never buy anything from Tesla again. PLEASE BE AWARE EVERYONE, don’t let them hurt you…..hopefully my true story helps something…",1,Trustpilot,US,

There was no one of authority to talk to regarding this matter and as usual, I did not get anywhere with the service advisor.

The following couple of weeks after that they reduced the value of the car to £42k - so we are stuck with a £49k finance on a  £42k car - so £7,000 of our hard earned money(finance) to light Elons bitcoin cigar.Not my favourite company right now, and with many years of finance remaining I am sure we will never ever do this again.

They changed the lower control arms saying they were worn and the cause of the noise.  Paid £850 and drove the car away noticing the noise was still there.  Complained to Tesla SC in Cardiff that noise was still there and was told that the lower arms were worn and were replaced.  They also advised that the driver side upper control arm needed replacement.  Despite my complaint that this should have been done in the first instance I agreed to get it done.  Brought the car in for it to be done and after one and half hours waiting was advised that both arms need replacing at a cost of over £1000.It was then that I lost it told them not to bother and just give me the car back.Tesla service Cardiff absolute joke.,1,Trustpilot,GB,

We now need to change my wife’s BMW X4 so I thought Tesla as we have live in a new Ultra modern self build house with 34 industrial size panels in our paddock. At the moment we are generating 12kWh and both our batteries are already fully charged so why not ?Unfortunately I have found it impossible to talk to Tesla’s UK call centre, it’s also impossible to talk to our local dealer in Bournemouth. We live about an hour’s drive from them so we need to know which cars, if any, they have in their Bournemouth store before making the 2 hour round trip. I have called several times over the last week and even took up the offer of a call back, which, after a painfully long wait, I gave up on. I just couldn’t wait any longer. Later that evening we did have a missed call from Tesla’s call centre, but it was obviously too much trouble for whoever bothered to call to leave a message. I mistakenly thought that someone would call back the next day as you do, but nothing  !Tried calling again today, before leaving for the Bournemouth store but gave up after listening to some rather annoying music for over half an hour and thinking that hopefully Tesla might do me a favour and just answer and sell me a car. I am obviously no different from the rest of you guys that have left feedback on this site, why I thought I was, was just wishful thinking on my part. I thought I would call our local BMW dealer in Yeovil to see how they fared and have just spoken with them regarding a new IX and I4, this took about 40 seconds including pushing the buttons on my phone. How would you go about solving a problem with a Tesla when you can’t even talk to someone when you want to buy one ?In my experience the sales people in any BMW, Mercedes or Audi dealership pickup within seconds of dialling but not Tesla UK.Anyway, it’s looking like my wife’s getting a new BMW and  hopefully I won’t have to wait as long as trying to talk to Tesla call centre for their share price to recover so that I can sell up and get out. Lastly we don’t have Tesla’s battery Power Wall system so at least we don’t need to deal with them regarding that, thank goodness.",1,Trustpilot,GB,

Really, $175 cost cutting on your flagship model.Day 2, paired phone not working. Drove to service center. Saw grand total of one service agent at the desk. Finally got my turn and was told nobody can take a look at the 2 day old car and I have to submit a service ticket. The scheduled ticket is 1 week away, so I bough the key fob so I don't have to swipe the key card to lock/unlock the car while waiting for service.

Also, over the past 4 years, I've used Tesla mobile service 4 times to perform tire rotations, replace cabin air filters and twice to sanitize the AC condenser coils when they started to smell. The mobile service teams are great. It's easy to schedule service through the Tesla app (although it can sometimes take a week or more in my area to get an appointment). The service tech has always arrived within the promised window and satisfactorily completed the service. In my experience, both my cars have been quite reliable and just needed minor maintenance which is typically performed by Tesla mobile service in my driveway.

Told they thought it was the passenger rear tire which did not match the other tires,  they exchanged it.  I told them and so they should since that tire was placed by their shop.  ( I had a nail in the cars original tire, so Tesla replaced it with a Michelin tire--the rest of the tires are Pirelli). Service person indicated that this tire was not placed by them.  I had to inform her that indeed it was and gave her the timeline of that replacement.  After checking her computer she finally acquiesced that was correct. Before I left the service center I looked to make sure that the replacement tire was a Pirelli and the size matched the other rear tire.   The following day I checked the tire pressures and found the replaced tire had 47 psi where the other 3 had 39, 40, and 41 psi.  Why would you have one tire that was so much more inflated.  Of note when the original tire that had the nail was exchanged the tire pressure on the exchange was also 47psi.Owners Manual and screen display indicate tire pressure should be 42 psi front and rear.

2022-09-28,Tesla Customers are 3rd Class Citizens,"I placed an order for a Model Y Nov 2021. Expected delivery date June 2022. I get global supply chain issues and was okay with this. Never do you get any updates. Called in June and was told, ""Oh, since you haven't listed a payment method, delivery has been pushed back to September."" WHAT?! Got a notice that a VIN had been assigned to my order but told I have 24 hours to choose one of three days for delivery and those dates are less than a week away. I work as an ED doc. what if I had shifts those days? I can't just easily rearrange. What if I had been on vacation? I would have been put back on the waiting list. When I FINALLY reached a customer service rep, no help. Told me best to take delivery one of those three days. Dropping >$60,000 on a car and I get treated like a teenager who wants the latest Hot Topic Gear. TESLA is basically treating it's customers like a commodity. Since there's high demand, they don't give a crap if the purchaser is dissatisfied. Add to this that now the cars no longer come with charging cables. don't get me wrong, they give you a credit to cover the cost of one but then that's a whole other step to get it. And, I entered the code, told by the website the code was accepted and I owed $0 then get a bill on my CC for the full cost. Now I have to dispute that. Hell, save us both some time and $$ and just give me the blood charger. Also come to find out, new Ys don't come with the homelink garage door opener installed. Bought an X 3 years ago and came standard. But now it's a $350 upgrade and I have to leave my car with them again. Why wasn't that listed as an option along with paint color, tow hitch etc?

2022-12-08,Tesla's idea of customer service is completely unacceptable,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love my Tesla Model S. It is a great car. But if you are considering buying a Tesla I strongly urge you DONT DO IT. I say this because Tesla service is possibly the worst I have ever experienced. The computer in my car was going out and to fix it Tesla gave me the option of installing a refurbished original system for $750 or a hot new infotainment upgrade for $2000. i went with the upgrade and when I picked up my car was shocked to find the new system did not come with AM/FM radio or Siriux XM satellite radio. Those are the two primary sources of music for me and what car audio system doesn't have them? They took these offerings away but will provide them for a ""software upgrade"" costing $500. I tried to reason with Tesla and said I would have gone with the cheaper solution had I known getting AM/FM radio (I like to listen to sports talk) or Sirius XM would cast an extra $500. But they said that a technician sent me a link over the Tesla service app that listed all the ""features and benefits"". I told them that taking something away is neither a feature or a benefit. I was sold on an ""upgrade"" that would fix all my car's problems and taking away my primary music sources is NOT an upgrade. Who follows a link and goes to read fine print about an upgrade to make sure things like major music sources aren't being taken away? It's like reading fine print to make sure you navigation system or brakes are still there. It's supposed to be an UPGRADE! They did not see it my way of course and that is a simple illustration of how little Tesla really cares about their service. Another major problem with Tesla service is that it is impossible to talk to a live human being. They force everything to be done through their app. Whenever I have needed service my appointments have been pushed back time and again. This last time one of my car's problems was that the wifi system was failing so they couldn't pull diagnostics from it remotely. I tried calling them to tell them about my problems but all phone calls circle right back to sending you to their app. I don't have problems with technology, but sometimes it is infuriating and it almost always is with Tesla. Can you imagine not being able to reach a real person no matter how hard you try.",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-10-08,I bought an x right before the…,"I bought an x right before the pandemic. It sat in my garage for a year. The few times I did drive it, the driver’s window would not roll up intermittently. I used the app for service. The guy came to repair it  and  from then forward there was HORRIBLE window noise. I took it in 7 x to the Decatur shop to get it fixed. They never could get it right. My car sat in the shop for months due to those 7 repair appointments. Then my app forgot that I owned the car. So there is no phone number to fix this and the coolant started running low. I drove to the shop to set an appt, they gave me an appt, then I drove it for service after waiting for the appt and not driving the car. Well they couldnt service it if I didnt have the app working. They wouldnt help me get the app to remember my car. So it sat for 3 weeks while I tried to figure out what to do. I am very busy so I couldnt spend hours going thru their circular phone-app-web-app- phone-app circle jerk to figure out what to do. I abhor the service experience with this car. Nothing is straightforward. And the people at the service department are condescending jerks. The computers always fall out of alignment so sometimes Ill spend my while 45 minute commute listening to the car ding every 2 minutes telling me a sensor isnt working. At the shop they say theres nothing they can do it's a software problem and they dont  know when the update will fix it. There are about 10 other issues like this where things will work one day, and will tick you completely off the next day. The car’s concept and service concept is great but they dont spend enough time testing it for issues. I have never been as frustrated as I am as the owner of this car. Im selling it and buying a porche cayenne again. This car also feels very cheap inside. I do like the integrated nav system and the speed and safety but great day it is a total pain in the rear otherwise. I will probably buy another one in about 5 years when its not at this proof of concept state. I really really dislike the people at this service dept and you dont have a choice to take it to another service dept. The App 100% dictated where the car is serviced.   It just really sucks all around.",1,Trustpilot,US,
2022-09-08,"Great car, terrible service","To say Tesla is bad at customer service is an understatement if I could have given them 0 stars I would.Most of the models in their range are considered by most to be prestige cars (or at least this is reflected in the price tag). I bought a Model S about three and a half years ago for nearly £95k, which compares to previous cars I’ve bought from Mercedes and Audi.Since then, I have been impressed by the capabilities and technology of the car, whilst at the same time irritated by the build quality and customer service.The latest issue has been with the windscreen washer pump, which has already been changed once about a year after I got the car. This in itself isn’t an issue to me; things go wrong its how they are dealt with that is the problem.I raised the service incident a few days after I noticed it had stopped working again, however it was about a week before a ranger could come out to fix it, again not an issue. The problem comes because I have gone over 50k mileage whilst waiting for it to be fixed, therefore making it not covered by the warranty. The ranger tried to fix the issue but failed, and I was asked to attend the Tesla Service Centre in Stratford upon Avon. I told them that I believed that the repair should be covered by the warranty and didn’t accept the quote for the work. When I took my car today I once again explain and told them I wasn’t happy, they said they would have a look into it. When they had finished, they told me they had fixed it and I needed to pay £135!!. This is for a pump which you can buy on the internet for about £5.To actually get my car back I had to pay this, no amount of complaining could change their stance.Insult to injury when I got my car back there was a tire pressure warning. I hadn’t even driven away! When I went back in, they told me it was already on when they got the car (this isn’t true and I asked them to check the car's logs to see this, which they declined). I said if it was on why didn’t they mention this, as a good customer service representative would! Their attitude was well tough!! I’m yet to see if there is any damage to the tire and if there is I will be pursuing it legally, just because their attitude stinks!I’ve owned several Mercedes, and there is no comparison! I won’t buy another Tesla purely because of their customer service!",1,Trustpilot,GB,
2022-11-29,I booked a Tesla 3 model this May 2022…,"I booked a Tesla 3 model this May 2022 and was awaiting my turn. I paid $250 as a down payment. On 13th October 2022 I get a message on Tesla site that my car will be ready with a vin number soon for delivery. I had to leave out of the country due to emergency in my family so I called the Tesla dealership where I was to pick up the car and they told me that since I could not pick up I would be placed back on waitlist  and I would get my delivery date not sooner then a month. Since I was to return by then I placed my car on hold for my next turn when the vin number was assigned to me on 17 th October 2022. To my surprise the same vin number was given to me on 27 th October 2022 again. Since it was the same vin number I wrote an email to Ms. Katie Crabb, one of Tesla online sales person in charge of my order, that I had requested to go back in waitlist line as I could not pick up the car with the same vin number that was sent to me on 17 October 2022 as I was out of the country due to emergency. Please advise as to why I am asked to pick up the car with the same vin number. She replied saying this is the vin given to you to pick up your car on 27 October 2022. She never explained that this was the second vin number and final one and if I don’t pick up then my order will be cancelled! I sent a couple of email to Ms. Katie Crabb asking her again and again that since it’s the same vin number was it for the first order, but no reply from her. What lousy customer service for a senior citizen like me. I finally was told my order was cancelled and they will neither refund me $250 nor use the same downpayment to book again!I email to her supervisor Mr. W. Secor from Tesla explaining the same but no reply since 25 days from him either. I send several reminders too to answer to my email yet no reply from the supervisor Mr. W Secor. I was really surprised and upset that a company like Tesla has no time or makes no effort to connect with their customers. All Tesla is interested is to collect as many down payments they can get to cancel orders. I was given wrong information by Tesla that it would atleast be a month before my next vin number was assigned but I was never assigned another vin number but the first vin that I had asked to hold and put me at the back of the line as waitlist. We senior citizen are not used to buying cars on line so it’s all new to us and Tesla is very tricky to make us believe that the first vin number will be different from the second vin number and that the second vin number would be allotted after atleast 3-4 weeks and I was allotted the same vin number in 10 days. Please be careful as Tesla is based on lies and no response from either the sales person allotted nor the mangers to help. It takes hours on the phone to reach customer Service. They are Fraud. Go use the dealership to buy cars but not Tesla. With this experience how can anyone trust Tesla as when we have problem with Tesla cars they will NOT be there to answer our questions. All they are interested in filling their pockets with as much money they can get by canceling Orders and No Reply either for emails sent.",1,Trustpilot,SG,
2022-09-05,model X,"We bought a model X.  No notification of delivery.  We had to drop everything to run up there last minute on Memorial Day or they said we would lose my place in line after waiting 14 months.  We just happened to look on the app the Thursday prior to the holiday weekend and it said to schedule our delivery.  This was our first and only notification.  Our only option for delivery was the following Monday, Tue or Wed....  So I delayed my trip to England, changed my tickets to go through ATL from our home in Florida and on Friday I worked out the financing of a 100k plus vehicle.  We had previously done the financing, but the original scheduled delivery of October 2021 had long passed and the financing expired.  In October, the delivery rolled to Nov, then in Nov to Dec etc.  This happened every month until Sept of 2022!  I landed on Monday, took the Metro to Decatur then an Uber to the dealer.  Bought the car, drove to ATL, parked it at ATL and continued to England.  Then when we returned, we had to fly through ATL and drive to Florida rather than direct to FL.  The inside of the windshield was so filthy on the drive home, when we turned into the sun, visibility was almost zero.  After we got it home, we could not add a key card.  The app said it was a known error that Tesla would have a fix for soon...  We tried to call but no answer.  I sent the Decatur rep, Roberto Perez an email because my fiancé couldn't use the car and it was her car.  He didn't reply.  I sent two more emails requesting a call.  Nothing...   Car sat in the driveway.  Finally I sent another email stating we are going to review this on every social media platform if we dont get a response.  Tried to call a dozen times, unable to get anyone.  Called Tesla and waited for 56 minutes on hold.  They sent a message to the location manager and promised a return call within an hour…. Lol yeah right.  Nothing.  So here is the complaint which I guess I will copy and paste on every platform I can find while I am again sitting on hold.  I strongly recommend waiting for Rivian or any other EV before purchasing a Tesla.  Decatur also forgot to sign the purchase agreement and have us sign it.  This, along with failing to send a picture of the window sticker, as instructed on the bank's draft check's instructions, caused the check to be canceled by the bank.  The best part is: still no contact from the manager at Decatur as promised numerous times?  How is he or she still employed by Tesla??

2022-11-10,Tesla sucks,"We vote negative stars for Tesla, and specifically the Rocklin service center.  We bought a 4 year service agreement with Tesla totaling $4000 when we bought our car in 2018, and in that agreement annual check ups were promised.  We had it serviced annually, in 2019 and 2020.  When we went to the 3rd appt in 2021 in Rocklin we were told that we only needed to come in every other year and that the service contract would never expire, and that we would be taken care of, and not to worry.  So here we are 2 years later, getting our car serviced and a $800+ bill that should be covered under the service contract.  We moved to Scottsdale and they tried calling Rocklin, I have tried calling Rocklin and got routed to some place where the guy is only taking ""notes"" he also shared that it is doubtful I will get any resolution.  There is no direct way to speak with anyone to hold them accountable and ""take care of us"" as we were promised.  There is also NO record of this appt that we were turned away from, therefore as far as Tesla is concerned is never happened and it almost feels like they are accusing us of making this story up!  From what we can tell Katie cancelled our appt on 8/3/21 and misunderstood our situation and caused all of this mess.  There is NO WAY my husband and I could or would run our small businesses this way.  Such a lack of responsibility and integrity.  Why would we have paid $4000 for a service agreement and only get 2 services out of it?  We got completely bamboozled by Tesla and they owe us the money they took for the service agreement, and/or the money we are having to pay to have our car serviced, plus the next service, as promised in our service agreement.  The gal (Katie) who turned us away that day 2 years ago needs much better training as it is costing us money that we have already spent!!  Tesla should have the integrity to speak with us directly and not hide behind a service agreement expiration date.  Furthermore they need to take responsibility for the employee, Katie, who they are paying to represent the company, and speaking on behalf of the company's policies and procedures.  Why would we not trust her and the advice she gave that day?  She was there working, wearing the Tesla T-shirt, speaking with authority.  They need to explain the bad information we got from her, and correct this situation.  This feels so disrespectful as an early Tesla buyer (before the crazy days with long delivery dates). We even bought a model Y recently and I now feel that was a mistake and now I want to get rid of both Teslas.  I like supporting business that maintain good values and treat their employees and customers well, and that has NEVER been my experience with Tesla.  My husband also bought his daughter a model S, and she unfortunately has also had countless issues with her car and dealing with the service center in Tucson.  Tesla just doesn't care, and I doubt I will ever hear from anyone.  As I told the agent over the phone, Tesla sucks, which made him angry.  I explained that it is actually that I am very troubled which is why I am angry- it is because I CARE, when clearly they do not.",1,Trustpilot,US,

2022-10-24,Is this the type of management that a corporation like TESLA allows on their facilities?,"Review: IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY; IT IS A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE! Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail/service location ignored our presence at their show room this past Monday. There were 4 Sales Advisors behind a desk to the left of the glass door to the showroom. All four were busy looking at pc and or iPad screens, and none of them acknowledged our presence for about 5 to 7 minutes of us standing about eight feet from them. Then, one whose name we will not motion here, who in the end was polite, asked what he could do for us. We explained that when we got delivery of our second Model S we were not given the second key-fob standardly provided on delivery at that time to any Model S new owner. We explained that we had called Customer service and that a representative said that a note would be placed on our account allowing the service to provide the free key-fob. As he could not find the note, he said that he would text that person internally to confirm. Upon leaving the dealership, as asked by that Sales Advisor, we called Customer Service back and spoke with a person who happened to have the same name as the one we had spoken to that morning. She saw no notes on the account but assured us she would not only type them in but contact via text that Advisor we had just spoken with. Well, last night I received a message, from that Advisor, in which he said they would not do that ""because he could not see any authorization on that and that his Management did not want to provide the replacement key fob for free as the ""too much time had passed since we purchased the Model S"". Principal: We have been a long-time loyal Tesla owner since 2016, with the plans to exchange our owned Model S for a Plaid Model in the first QT of 2023. The extremely poor and unthought-out decision by the Fort Lauderdale Manager, as we were told, is so unfortunate! It is not business oriented at all that a Tesla Dealership Manager would not provide his customer with a free key fob which at cost for Tesla would represent less than 0.04% of the price of the car we intend to buy! Well, the price that they would charge of $217.75 is not the question here, but what does matters is the fact is that we were not provided with the second fob at delivery of our brand-new Tesla Model S at that time, therefore we should not be incurring in this expense at all. It is a question of principle, not money! For a long time, we have been noticing that Tesla is declining their customer service as originally experienced by us in 2016. It was awesome until we believe 2018! Since them we waited at times almost one hour on the phone to get a representative over the phone, and we were treated with disrespect at least two times at the North Lauderdale Service/Retail branch. At a time in which serious competition, not too much for the model S, is knocking on Tesla's doors day by day louder and louder it does become crucially important that Tesla pays attention and moves their service to one of the utmost Excellence. We would like the Management at Fort Lauderdale to be aware of what they are doing in terms of customer service, both on the retail and on the service side. On our last visit the speakers were blasting with rock music, so loud that the service representative behind the counter needed to scream at him so that we could understand him and vice versa. The service center looked disorganized and very confusing! On top of that we were ignored also by one of the persons on the second roll of counters, which was a female. She never acknowledged our presence as well. This is unacceptable! We would like to get this situation resolved and obtain the key fob which was never provided to us at delivery by the Dania Beach location (they were awesome to us on any encounter). Too bad that they are now closed!",1,Trustpilot,US,
2022-08-13,we have not yet received our car,"we have not yet received our car. we ordered it January 22 from chadston shopping center in Melbourne victoria. when we place the order it was fantastic. Person who set us up was great. They offered finance solutions through their finance partner Pepa money(EV Direct). it was great. We fill all forms required electronically with the tesla sales person. My wife and i applied for a joint load. Pepa approved the loan our delivery was due in april 22.  The. due to delay we were informed that delivery of the car will be delayed and new schedule is August to October 22. We were happy to wait and had no issues. Finally now all has come closer and Tesla is closer to delivery. But this is when all extremely poor service started. Tesla has no human touch at this point. They don't care and would like to demand and command the customer to things. my invoice was sent via the tesla account and it was one of those day that i was very busy on the road with my work. i rang and ask one of the team members if he could email it to me on PDF for so that i can send it to Pepa for payments. This gentle man said no worries and send it to me under W minutes. That was brilliant servide. However i did not notice that the invoice they send had only may name on it and my wife's names was missing. i send the invoice to pepa. Then after a week Pepa send me an email saying that both delivery address and invoice address is incorrect and to ask Tesla to correct it. I spoke with a team member and she said i will resend to your email again but it is correct. So i forward that to Pepa and again and told them Tesla mentioned that nothing is wrong with addresses, they are correct. Then i call Pepa and ask what is happening. Then they apologised and said sorry it is not the address it should have both you and your wife's name on invoice and on delivery address because have a joint loan. I rang again and ask Tesla to correct it. Then a team member said sure will update it on your app account soon.I had a look at the account after 6 hours and it was not updated. Then i rang them again and ask about it but they did not show any care for my request. They just said they don't happen like you ask they will take time. Then i ask due to this if my delivery get held up what will happen. Then they said we will hold it only for one week and we will give it to another customers. This is the time i realise how poor the service from these guys are. I have waited 6 Months and when the car is ready to be delivered this is what i am going through. Not only that, then i requested when it is updated to send it to my email account soon as they have it ready so that i can forward that to Pepa without having to go to a computer down load from the app and forward to pepa. This is where all the bad things happen. He said no we will not email you to give me hard time. then i receive and email saying due to security reasons they will not email any one on PDF form and only way to access is via the app. At this point Tesla has twiced email me the invoice on PDF version to my email account and i was able to send it to Pepa straight from my phone. So how comes if it is security breach, they did send that twice. This is not security breach from my view. Also i don't think this covers Australian law. Just imagine some one who has no skills to use computers but can drive and has money to by a tesla on a loan dealing with this. Are they going to discriminate them and say no you can not receive invoices via email or as a hard document? Not only this after all these battles i am still waiting for the correct invoice. Today is 13/8/22 and the invoice on my tesla app account is still with only my name and it has not been updated with my wife's name on it. This is the experience before i have that dream car but what it will be after? I know the car is great and it will not give me this bad expertise.",1,Trustpilot,AU,
2022-09-05,Worst Customer Service - Never Buy Again,"Customer service and service centers have been awful since day one. It’s so bad that I would never buy another one. Paid over $120k for my model X and they can’t even treat you with basic customer service skills let along show appreciation for you as a customer. When I picked up my car for the first time four years ago, they towed away my trade in without letting me clean out my stuff! They couldn’t locate it until the next day and by then, thousands of dollars worth of designer sunglasses, jackets, car seats and items with sentimenal value was stolen. The last straw for me (and why I’m writing this review right now) is I brought in my car to the Burlingame, CA service center on a Thursday morning, expecting my car to be ready the same day, only to be told it wouldn’t be available until Saturday. I brought it in to fix recurring issues that they caused! One being I bought new tires that Tesla installed but the next day ended up with a flat tire on the side of the road. A tow, a visit from Tesla mobile, and a wasted Sunday afternoon later, the mobile tech said the screws weren’t tightened by the rep on my new tires which caused the leak and the flat tire. So back to Tesla I go. Second issue, I got the falcon wings seal replaced under warranty because it was cracked and went to get a car wash, and a puddle of water was sitting in my back seat. Back to Tesla I go! My passenger door window often squeaks as it rolls up and down, sometimes not going up or down with the auto-window function. Service center said all I need to do is clean the glass with glass cleaner to remedy the problem. WHAT?!? So another reason to go back to Tesla! All these problems were supposed to be resolved and my car ready on Saturday (3 days after initial drop off). Then I get a message on Saturday that said they would re-prioritize my car on Monday to work on it. So four days of my car sitting there without being worked on while I have a loaner car. Monday comes along and they say the car won’t be ready until Wednesday. Wednesday comes and now the car won’t be ready until Thursday. Great, except for the fact I’m leaving for a trip to Southern California on Thursday evening. Thursday late afternoon comes and I get a message saying my car won’t be ready until Friday!!! So basically I won’t have my car back for my road trip. At this point I’m stressed out and ask them to call me in the mobile app since there is no way to call the service center directly. No response. I explain I’m going on a road trip and am asking if I can take the loaner car with me. No response. Then they tell me the loaner agreement states I will be charged for miles over 200 miles and per day I keep the loaner after my car is ready. I text again to call me so we could talk through these charges AND I called the customer service line which was absolutely useless. I got no response from anyone. Finally spoke to the service center manager on Saturday (two days later), who was argumentative, condescending and unprofessional. He repeated he’s the highest level manager of the facility and he basically said I was liable for the loaner car fees, but if I had come in to see him in person, he would have waived the fees. When I asked why they didn’t honor my request to call me, he said they were too busy and it was end of day. They want to hold me to my rental agreement, but they don’t want to honor the service agreement that said my car should have been ready days before my trip. To end my story, Tesla kept my car over a week, didn’t communicate the issues with me, then charged me to use the loaner car, because they couldn’t get my car ready before my trip and wouldn’t work with me on a problem they caused.I’ve had multiple cars in the past and have never had such poor customer service, poor technicians and are treated like a second rate citizen all at the same time. I will never again purchase a Tesla. The car is great but it’s not worth this level of bullying and disrespect. Tesla has such a large share of the EV market, they feel like they can treat their customers like crap after purchase. I’m rooting for all the small guys to come up and take over!",1,Trustpilot,US,
2022-08-22,Tesla after sales is worse than appalling,"I have a 2019 tesla X 100D purchase price c£117000.00I don't usually revert to complaining like this but anybody reading please be aware....The Tesla after sales is worse than appalling and I can't begin to express my frustration enoughI have been lucky enough to have owned some amazing high end vehicles including Aston Martin DB9, Maserati Gran Cabriolet, Ferrari 575M Marinello (Still got it) and Audi RS6Im not bragging as I know how lucky I have been to experience some awesome cars and have had dealings with after sales teams looking after expensive vehiclesI decided to go for the X as I felt it was time to go electric and it seemed to fit the billThe model X (300 mile range) only ever charges to 257 miles but thats not the issueDue to the shabby build quality the car has been into the Tesla Service Centre (SC) on a number of occasions I have now been waiting months to have the faulty suspension fixed and at every point of contact with either the Tesla telephone support team or through the APP have been met with total BS, empty promises, incompetence and failure to get the simplest of things in place providing the merest hint of customer satisfaction I had to use the car to go to Devon and the Tesla team told me that if I had an issue on the trip to call roadside assistance!GET THISAfter protracted 'negotiation' I eventually was able to accept an appointment made by the telephone support team to have my vehicle fixedSince then (months) due to lack of parts or some other excuses my appointments have been cancelled time and time again the day before the appointment with no resolution in siteI can wait to get the issues fixed and get rid if this skipI would advise anyone thinking of buying a Tesla to just think about and revue against the competition: Build qualityThe guys and customers at our local BMW garage were laughing at how mismatched the panels are. One of their customers who also had a model S said 'remember......it's a Tesla' After sales serviceYou can only go to Tesla for after sales who have a limited SC coverage and believe me they know it Don't count on getting anything done fast or to your satisfaction If you are used to good customer service and decide to buy a Tesla please manage your expectations and be prepared to enter a world of pain!As mentioned I can't wait to get the faults sorted with this vehicle and get rid of it ASAP!Anyone want a Tesla ?SO TO CONTINUEThe very next day after posting this review Tesla called me to advise that all parts were in and the job can be completed The guy asked me what they could do to help ease the situation as he had read all of the logs and could understand my frustrationIt is agreed that Tesla will collect my car on 07th Sept, leave a loaner, fix my car and bring it back to collect their loanerIm not holding my breath as I am fully expecting a note delaying the appointment on the 06th or a denial of the agreement (I couldn't make it up?)Lets seeModel X still for sale at some time in the future.....Conclusion....... The vehicle was collected.... a day earlyNot an issue as I was happy to get ridAfter a couple of days I was asked if it was OK to carry our a factory reset to clear all GPS locations and eradicate the weird raising and lowering issue.... I agreedThe SC contacted me asking when I would like to collect the vehicle..... I refused as the deal was that they would deliver it back to meThey did the next dayThe representative was informative by explaining what had been done to rectify all of my issuesThe cost would have been, if not under warranty, way over £2000.00So since I have owned the vehicle (a 2019) over £3000.00 worth of parts and labour have been allocated to itOn the first outing...... the suspension raised unexpectedly and I called the rep as the factory reset obviously did not resolve the issueFortunately there was a quick fix and I have now switched off the auto raise and lowerThe rep also advised me to drive always in the normal setting as anything else will cause wear to the inside or outside of the tyresNow I have a Tesla that works and for some freak reason my battery full charge capacity has increased from a max of 252 miles to 261???Looking at and testing alternative EV offers I can't find anything that delivers better range and software than the X that I have so will keep this vehicle until the warranty is up..... then its outThe issue with Tesla is the the build quality is not able to compete with its European rivals and due to a lack of spare parts and staff after sale support is appallingLets hope it all improves for Tesla in the future as I would not wish my experience upon ....... most people",1,Trustpilot,GB,
