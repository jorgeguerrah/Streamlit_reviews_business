They had dog toys,bamboo makeup brushes, multi colored wine glasses, and mini fridge for me to store my cold makeup products in it.  I also love their amazing deal with anything over $25 dollars is free shipping.  I also love when they tell you what date your package is supposed to arrive. The shippers are careful with all the packages I have ordered which I appreciate since some of my items are fragile. When I ordered a twin size mattress for my daughter it was packaged to my house with care and wasn't just thrown on the ground like trash.  When we unboxed the mattress it was soft when I first felt it and it was covered in plastic covering which I like so no stains gets on the mattress before I get it. I also bought a bed frame for the new bed for my daughter and it came with directions which I also like because most places assume you know how to put a bed frame up so they don't give you instructions.",5,Bestcompany,,MD

I could have got on eBay and ordered the same thing $5 cheaper and they say it'll be here in 3 or 4 days instead of lying just to get you to buy it. This used to be a great company.

Even when I had already restarted my system multiple times, your employee told me 36 hours later just to restart the entire system. The guidance is an absolutely unacceptable when I had already done that.

Called and got a lady named TONI who told me she would refund my CC and would send me an email verifying this within a few minutes. I never got an email so called and transferred to a supervisor. She said I was not refunded and would correct this as the book never came as it was returned 8 days ago. Customer service has gone downhill real fast! It does not matter if you are a Prime member for a decade+, or if you place a lot of orders. The supervisor did follow through and sent an email as promised.

When you call you can tell by how they confirm your account. I decided to call back 10 hours later and how interesting I was able to get the refund but the last agent from a different call center quotes a policy that is clearly ""flexible"".

But it's a whole big runaround before you can actually talk to someone, by then 20 minutes have gone by. They should send a text or email an hour before your package is due to arrive. I'm a prime member (which they increased the price....a lot) for about 8 years and feel like I'm not getting much benefits from it. There has been quite a delay with the shipping lately, returning something is not so simple anymore.

To this day, Amazon has never attempted to discuss lemons into lemonade. They just like to keep you sucking their sour ways of not dealing with something or admitting they're in the wrong, and ignoring you with just citing vague company policies. ",1,Consumeraffairs,,GA

It first started with damaged product, which has happened on at least 3 separate purchases - sometimes repeatedly on the replacements. These were all books and console game discs, which are small in size and easily affected by mistreatment during transportation. Speaking of shipping, why the unrealistic ETAs on the product pages?

Amazon is responsible for making sure my packages get to my door. That’s why I pay extra to use their site. The only company that does bring to me is the one being evaluated each delivery. I feel as though I’m being punished for living in an apartment. Too many lazy delivery guys will leave my packages at the entrance to my building. That would be equivalent to leaving a box at the end of someone’s driveway. I’ve had young men leave extremely heavy boxes for me to drag home. Even if I catch up to them they say they don’t care.

Next day guarantee. They changed it to 3 days away. I chatted with the agent. It was horrible. I have screen shots of the whole situation.

After a few months the table started blistering and the chairs were leaking a rusty discharge after rains. Contacted Amazon, no help! Vendor offered $40 for table because it was still usable in their opinion. Replacement parts for chairs. Here’s the Big Problem, it is not outdoor furniture as advertised. It is rusting from the inside out. I paid almost $1300 and now I am stuck with a rust bucket.",1,Consumeraffairs,,TN

It gets worse, the language barrier is so bad, I can't understand them or vice versa, causing me to give up most of the time. The automatic computer ""help"" is the worst I've ever seen.

I purchased a gaming PC in January from a 3rd party seller that I later learned was damaged. Contacted the seller and the manufacturer and never got any responses so I contact a rep to request a partial refund acknowledging that I was past the 30 window. The rep approved the request and sent me the label and the shipping instructions. Seller tries to deny it stating they’d send the pc back if attempted.,1,Consumeraffairs,,NC

The benefits you pay for by having Amazon Prime are untrue. You pick your delivery date and they get it to you when they want and then you are expected to wait at home all day to get your order because they just leave it at the door. Amazon Prime isn't worth it, and calling customer service isn't any better. Just excuses after excuses. Walmart's version of prime works much much better and I get my stuff when they say I will or they contact me to let me know why there will be a delay instead of just changing it online and you happen to see it if you check otherwise you don't know they have changed it on you. Worst customer service ever!",1,Consumeraffairs,,IN

Of late, I've experienced unfilled orders, late deliveries and once, I never received the purchase. Amazon refunded my purchase in the form of a gift card. I was given an option of gift card or refund my credit card. I chose gift card because it would've taken several days to receive the credit back to my card. Normally, if Amazon delivers the purchase, everything is fine. However, if they use a third-party shipper, i.e. DHL, FedEx, I might get it about a week to 2 weeks after ordering. Overall, I will continue to use Amazon. I use them mainly because they have products that I can't find anywhere else and a better prices. As a prime member, shipping is free. Years ago I would recommend Amazon to anyone. Now, I'm not too sure. Customer Service should be improved.",3,Consumeraffairs,,NY

I did as they asked within a couple hours and I never received the credit. When I called the next day I was told ""oh this is a 2 to 14 day return process for this item"" which annoyed me because the item I returned Was a blanket cover and now my down comforter did not have a cover on it and I can't find one conveniently locally in retail so I reluctantly agreed although what else could I do, to wait the 14 days at which time I was told if I did not receive the refund and the item had been received by them, that I would get a full refund on the 14th day.

Two of the boxes were crushed in multiple places; but when I tried to return them, I was told that ""This usually doesn't happen"" and that there would be no refund because ""the item is still usable"". I felt like they were calling me a liar, so I sent photos of the boxes and the envelope. I was more insulted that they told me that the cookies were ""still usable""; if I had seen these boxes in a grocery store, I would have left them there. The fact that they expected me to just suck it up only pissed me off; if I wouldn't accept it in a store, I'm not going to accept it online. ",1,Consumeraffairs,,OH

Then when they ask you for a review and don't like it they actually edited & altered my review of the experience by drawing a line through it to make it unreadable.
